{"id": "id_0", "input": "In my view, it is not advisable for teenagers to hold jobs while they are students. While many assert that it offers valuable work experience, I believe it may disrupt their lives in multiple ways. Taking on jobs can negatively impact a student's health. It shifts their focus away from academics and robs them of their childhood.\nIn today's competitive environment, students must dedicate significant time to their studies to excel. They need to invest most of their time in school to achieve good grades. Engaging in a job during their remaining time would add extra pressure on them. Additionally, Jobs come with various obligations like attendance, occasional overtime, and more. This leads to stress, anxiety, and exhaustion. They won't have enough time to relax or sleep properly. Consequently, this would harm their mental and physical well-being.\nAnother point is that jobs can distract students from their academic pursuits. If students start earning at a young age, they may become fixated on money. They may feel self-sufficient and prioritize earning more over their studies. This would detract from their academic focus, causing them to lose interest in education. Furthermore, Some may even abandon their studies to earn more money.\nAlongside this, One significant disadvantage of teenage employment is missing out on the joys of childhood. They would miss out on childhood activities like socializing with friends, clubs, fun activities, and interaction with peers. While they have their entire lives to work and achieve success, their childhood phase is irreplaceable. Therefore, they should make the most of life's opportunities while they can.\nThus, it is crucial for teenagers to concentrate on their studies.

{"id": "id_1", "input": "In today's world, closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras have become prevalent in many settings. They are employed in educational institutions, businesses, and various other locations to oversee activities occurring within these spaces. There is no doubt that CCTV usage brings numerous advantages, notably in curbing criminal activities and ensuring the safety of employees. Despite this, some individuals contend that their privacy is being compromised due to constant surveillance. Nonetheless, I firmly assert that CCTV cameras ought to be installed in all premises to tackle the rising theft rates and safeguard employees at their workplaces.\nTo begin with, installing CCTV cameras at workstations can lead to a reduction in criminal activities like theft. This is due to the fact that when a store is targeted by robbers, footage captured by these cameras serves as crucial evidence to identify and track down the culprits. For instance, in Malaysia, law enforcement utilized CCTV footage to track and apprehend a group of thieves who broke into a Seven Eleven store during the night. Moreover, knowing they are under continuous observation, employees are less likely to commit theft in the shops. Therefore, it is evident that CCTV systems should be installed in all workplaces to diminish crime rates.\nIn addition, in certain workplaces, staff are frequently tasked with managing irate or distressed customers. Occasionally, interacting directly with a displeased customer can pose physical threats to the employee. Hence, CCTV installation may assist employees in avoiding such perilous situations because customers are acutely aware that their conversations are being recorded. In the event of a dispute, video recordings can be employed to ascertain the actual events, enabling appropriate measures to be taken. In summary, these surveillance systems offer a level of protection for workers against customer-related incidents.\nFrom a different angle, the deployment of CCTV cameras does stir debate. Critics of CCTV systems argue that their privacy is violated due to persistent surveillance. However, it is crucial to recognize that safety takes precedence over privacy, and prevention is preferable to enduring the consequences. Consequently, those who oppose the system should strive to understand the rationale and take preventative measures to avoid becoming crime victims.\nIn conclusion, CCTV cameras are vital and should therefore be installed in every location. Primarily, this is to protect individuals from potential harm by intruders or thieves. While it is true that privacy is compromised with the implementation of these surveillance cameras. Nevertheless, prioritizing safety is essential for ensuring one's protection.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay085", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 521, "to": 648}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 665, "to": 762}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 793, "to": 930}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 946, "to": 1091}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1103, "to": 1204}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1236, "to": 1310}], "label": "Claim", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1325, "to": 1419}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1435, "to": 1524}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1533, "to": 1608}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1617, "to": 1688}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1717, "to": 1823}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1837, "to": 1938}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2013, "to": 2104}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2115, "to": 2242}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2258, "to": 2390}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2407, "to": 2481}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2483, "to": 2568}], "label": "Claim", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2592, "to": 2668}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2684, "to": 2746}], "label": "Premise", "id": 18}], "edges": [{"source": 5, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 16, "target": 17, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 17, "target": 18, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 5, 11, 12, 15, 16]}

From my perspective, even though endangered species hold significant importance, the needs of humans should be prioritized more.\nTo begin with, the population is steadily growing, which means the demand for food among humans is also on the rise. We require farmland to cultivate crops like wheat and corn, and it is certain that without food, people cannot survive for more than a few weeks. Consequently, farmlands are essential for human survival.\nAdditionally, individuals require shelters to shield themselves from natural elements such as wind, floods, and wild animals, resulting in the fact that land is necessary for constructing their homes. Housing is an undeniable human necessity, just like food.\nLastly, humans need certain essential things to sustain their lives, many of which are industrial, like medicine. As a result, some areas must be allocated for industrial purposes. Today's challenges are made more manageable with industrial assistance.\nIn summary, the number of endangered animals is far less than the human population, indicating that they do not require as much land as humans do.

{"id": "id_3", "input": "When deciding on a career path, it's crucial to weigh the options carefully. People have varying perspectives on whether to pursue a profession similar to their parents' or not. Personally, I believe opting for a career similar to one's parents can enhance one's professional journey. \nTo start with, since parents operate in the same sector, they can offer substantial support to their children, including specialized knowledge and industry insights. Take my situation, for example: my father is a software engineer, and he has significantly aided my understanding of programming and computer science. Whenever I encounter challenges, I consult him for advice. Given that his wealth of experience, allows me to save a great deal of time in troubleshooting. This gives me a competitive edge over my peers. Had I chosen a field different from my father's, I would encounter greater challenges than I do currently.\nOn the other hand, since parents have dedicated decades to their careers, they have built extensive networks within their industry. They possess profound understanding and can offer considerable guidance to their children. For example, they are aware of which companies offer superior benefits or training programs. Additionally, their industry acquaintances might even assist by writing recommendation letters for specific companies. There is no doubt that a strong recommendation letter is crucial in today's competitive environment. While others are still drafting their resumes, those with excellent recommendation letters have already advanced past the initial interview stage. \nSome may counter that, due to changing times, the job market landscape has drastically evolved. Thus, selecting a career similar to one's parents' may not always be the best choice. I partially agree with this viewpoint, but when considering trends, predicting them accurately is impossible. The job market transforms rapidly, making it impossible to predict it's unpredictable whether any career will remain popular for three decades or longer.\nIn evaluating whether to choose a career akin to one's parents', I've highlighted several reasons that individuals can receive greater support from their parents if they are in the same field.

Compassion, a principle advocated by nearly all religions, including Buddhism and Islam, is what sets humans apart from other creatures.\nLooking at the economic angle, such assistance can foster a mutually beneficial scenario. Less developed countries undoubtedly reap immediate advantages from such initiatives. For developed countries, the emergence of new medical challenges from work in less developed regions is a possibility, thereby research efforts are then undertaken to tackle these issues, furthering advancements in the pharmaceutical sector. The potential consumer base in these impoverished nations, many of which have large populations, is also significant. By cultivating positive relations with them, affluent countries can not only expand their international markets but also smooth the path for future global trade.

Ultimately, she graduated with excellent grades.\nFurthermore, students should not be mandated to attend classes because they can allocate time spent on classes to pursue other beneficial activities if they have a solid grasp of the classroom topics. Based on my experience, I often skipped biology classes since my university did not mandate attendance. Additionally, I had already covered all biology topics before starting university. Consequently, I utilized the time allocated for biology classes to work on my Chemistry research, earning an A+ in both subjects. \nIn summary, I believe students should be aware of how to prioritize their activities and manage their study time effectively.

Therefore, I firmly believe that you should concentrate on your strengths.\nConcentrating on your strengths aids in achieving your objectives. Undoubtedly, the more time you invest in what you excel at, the greater your chances of achieving remarkable success. For example, Albert Einstein, one of the most renowned physicists in history, dedicated the majority of his life to developing theories in physics, ultimately establishing the theories of special and general relativity. On the other hand, he rarely concerned himself with other matters. It is reported that, surprisingly, he couldn't differentiate between hand soap and facial soap, as for him, using two different soaps appropriately was rather bothersome. The example above illustrates that focusing on your strengths increases your chances of achieving your goals.\nBy consistently engaging in activities you excel at, you can improve further. When you excel at something, it brings satisfaction and heightens your interest. Subsequently, this self-motivation drives you to achieve more. To illustrate, I excelled in mathematics during my junior high school years. Because I took great satisfaction in my ability to perform well, I immersed myself in tackling more advanced mathematical problems.

{"id": "id_9", "input": "In most nations, artists enjoy the liberty to convey their ideas through their work. However, some contend that governmental constraints should be imposed to curb their expressions. Personally, I concur with this viewpoint only partially and assert that artists should be granted freedom to create truly remarkable masterpieces.\nThe primary argument is that imposing restrictions on artists' ideas will ultimately stifle their creativity. It's clear that when given the chance to express themselves, most artists tend to think innovatively and produce outstanding works, be it paintings or films. A case in point is artworks by Da Vinci and Michelangelo continue to be celebrated today because they were not subject to limitations during their time. Essentially, unfettered freedom will lead to more breathtaking creations from our artists.\nMoreover, every individual has the right to express their opinions in any form, as long as it doesn't harm the nation. today, numerous countries strive to demonstrate their commitment to democracy. art serves as a medium to critique societal issues and governmental policies within a country. To further illustrate, the acclaimed film '3 Idiots', featuring Amir Khan, critiques the education system for its focus on rote learning rather than practical application. Hence, denying artists the freedom to express their emotions freely undermines human rights.\nFrom a different angle, there are potential downsides if artists operate without restrictions. artists might delve into topics that generate controversy within a nation. For instance, Malaysia is a multicultural nation where citizens coexist peacefully. if sensitive issues concerning any ethnic groups are raised in films or books, it could lead to societal unrest. Still, I hold the belief that artists are well aware of their limits and would avoid tarnishing their reputations through reckless actions.\nIn summary, it's apparent that there should be no constraints on the artistic creations. granting them the freedom to think allows them to express themselves, as ideas can flow naturally in the absence of restrictions. Therefore, even though the freedom for idea expression can have some adverse effects, I am convinced that many exquisite and captivating artworks exist because of the liberty to express ideas and thus, I firmly maintain artists should not face any limitations.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay081", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 254, "to": 327}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 358, "to": 437}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 455, "to": 595}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 616, "to": 748}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 763, "to": 839}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 851, "to": 958}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 960, "to": 1037}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1039, "to": 1132}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1157, "to": 1304}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1313, "to": 1397}], "label": "Claim", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1494, "to": 1567}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1583, "to": 1651}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1653, "to": 1764}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1796, "to": 1904}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1937, "to": 1993}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1995, "to": 2063}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2068, "to": 2123}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2136, "to": 2209}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2231, "to": 2316}], "label": "Claim", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2345, "to": 2384}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 19}], "edges": [{"source": 4, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 17, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 4, 9, 12, 14, 18, 19]}

Studies indicate that friendships formed at university often become lifelong, and this is particularly true for roommates. From my perspective, the most crucial trait of good roommates is being considerate. Meanwhile, effective communication is also a vital characteristic of a good roommate.\nBeing considerate is consistently vital in relationships. For instance, a roommate lowers the volume of music or the television at night. Sometimes, we don't realize our actions until we're on the receiving end. Always considering others' feelings before any selfish actions can greatly enhance roommate relationships. Consequently, having a considerate roommate is crucial for our academic life. It not only helps avoid conflicts but also fosters friendships or even familial bonds.\nFurthermore, communication equally contributes to being a good roommate. People have varying daily habits, like making the bed in the morning. Some may see this as a simple task, while others find it a significant undertaking. If someone decides to move out because their roommate doesn't make the bed, it might be an overreaction. Thus, communication holds immense importance as it helps eliminate misunderstandings. Effective communication builds bonds and enhances mutual understanding.\nTo sum up, many valuable factors regarding roommates hold great importance.

{"id": "id_13", "input": "When choosing a place to live, the availability of public services and amenities is a top priority. Nevertheless, it is challenging to find a community that perfectly fulfills all our expectations. In my hometown, while most public services are adequately provided, transportation remains an issue. Therefore, the aspect I am most eager to improve is the availability of public transportation options. Given that I confront traffic jams daily. And this problem seems to be worsening.\nInitially, there should be more options for public transportation, such as subways or elevated trains. Consequently, individuals will have more means to reach their destinations. Since currently, buses are the sole form of public transportation in this area, This leaves residents with no alternative. They are compelled to rely solely on buses to travel elsewhere. With the introduction of subways and elevated trains, it would be more convenient for them. For instance, people can plan their journey using subway schedules. Conversely, this is not possible with bus services. Furthermore, this enhancement will indirectly alleviate road traffic congestion.\nSecondly, buses only offer two routes within this locality. This represents a significant issue. For example, if my desired destination doesn't fall within a bus route, I still need to take a bus to the central station and switch to another bus. Clearly, this is a wasteful use of time. More bus routes should be added to facilitate easier transportation for residents.\nFinally, expanding public transportation can reduce the reliance on personal cars. Additionally, it offers numerous benefits. For example, individuals can cut back on fuel expenses, which are on the rise.

This trend is not limited to affluent students; it is also embraced by those from less privileged backgrounds. Some students spend a year or two traveling across the globe, while others opt to gain work experience.\nThe experience obtained by visiting various locations, interacting with diverse individuals, or through employment proves invaluable in the long run. It boosts a student's self-assurance and fosters independence. Students who work accumulate better financial resources, providing them with support during their university education. Such experiences help them understand the path they wish to pursue in life. They develop a wider perspective, enabling them to make more informed decisions regarding their future studies or career paths.\nChoosing to take a break has its advantages, but it also presents certain drawbacks. Once students begin earning, they may be reluctant to return to academia, where they would lose financial independence. They might also struggle to readjust to the academic environment. There is a possibility that students may never return to university or pursue higher education. Some might opt for short-term courses instead of a comprehensive university education, aiming for better job prospects and higher salaries. This approach might only offer short-term benefits, as it is widely acknowledged that a solid career in the long term requires proper and advanced qualifications.\nFrom my perspective, I support the notion of taking a break before commencing higher education.

Nevertheless, there are still those who strongly hold that qualifications should remain the most critical factor. This essay seeks to examine both perspectives and share my personal stance on the matter. \nTo begin with, some argue that academic qualifications should be the primary standard for evaluating an employee's worth. It is crucial for employees to possess adequate education and training to effectively carry out their job responsibilities. In particular, professionals in fields like medicine are mandated to hold a university degree as well as years of practical experience. Furthermore, social skills are comparatively less relevant since they do not directly influence the outcome of tasks such as a surgical procedure. \nConversely, there is no denying that social skills are increasingly being acknowledged as vital by more employers. This is largely because modern work environments often require employees to collaborate in teams. interpersonal skills are pivotal in fostering cooperation among colleagues, especially in conflict situations. enhanced social skills enable individuals to resolve disputes in a more amicable manner. Additionally, businesses have increasingly shifted towards a customer-centric model. strong social skills empower employees to build lasting relationships with clients, ultimately improving customer satisfaction.\nFrom my perspective, I am inclined to believe that academic qualifications remain the cornerstone in assessing an employee's ability to perform their job.

{"id": "id_16", "input": "In recent times, transportation methods have garnered significant attention. Some argue that cars are the most convenient mode of transport, while others believe that alternative transportation should be prioritized considering environmental pollution. Personally, I firmly support the idea that alternative transportation methods and global regulations on car usage should be implemented. This essay will explore several reasons in the following sections.\nTo begin with, an increase in car numbers leads to environmental pollution. Given that car emissions and carbon dioxide negatively affect air quality, the polluted air results in respiratory issues for local residents. Consequently, it is essential to switch to alternative transportation and establish laws to regulate car usage.\nMoreover, more cars result in severe traffic congestion. being caught in traffic jams causes significant time wastage. Even more concerning, traffic congestion frustrates drivers, leading to more accidents. Therefore, strategies to reduce car numbers and manage car ownership and usage must be promptly developed and executed.\nTo address these issues, alternative transportation and global laws regulating car ownership and usage can be highly effective. Regarding the first point, alternatives that produce less carbon dioxide and emissions than cars are preferable. For instance, a bicycle rental system has been adopted in several European nations. In this system, rental bikes are available in each district, allowing people to travel to other areas for a small fee. As bicycles emit neither carbon dioxide nor harmful gases, they are a more environmentally friendly option than cars. Concerning the second point, implementing international laws can also be advantageous. For example, there are rules that restrict car usage to certain times and limit individuals to owning only one car. Hence, these initiatives to decrease car numbers can help alleviate traffic congestion and reduce environmental pollution.\nIn conclusion, despite the fact that some individuals argue for the convenience of cars, I would argue that alternative modes of transportation and international regulations on car control are essential for environmental protection and easing traffic congestion.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay031", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 296, "to": 388}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 472, "to": 531}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 544, "to": 606}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 608, "to": 674}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 690, "to": 786}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 798, "to": 843}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 845, "to": 905}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 929, "to": 993}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1006, "to": 1113}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1140, "to": 1241}], "label": "Claim", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1270, "to": 1354}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1370, "to": 1438}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1440, "to": 1557}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1562, "to": 1616}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1618, "to": 1675}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1706, "to": 1762}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1777, "to": 1878}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1887, "to": 2001}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2040, "to": 2090}], "label": "Claim", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2111, "to": 2264}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 19}], "edges": [{"source": 3, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 4, 8, 9, 18, 19]}
{"id": "id_17", "input": "In today's fast-paced and highly competitive world, we find ourselves in complex situations that often lead to stress. To combat this, many individuals seek various activities to alleviate their stress levels. Personally, I believe that engaging in activities like listening to music, playing sports, and practicing meditation are straightforward and effective stress relievers.\nTo begin with, music serves as an excellent tool for relaxation. For instance, during my daily commute to the office using public transport, I encounter traffic jams, crowded bus stops, and packed buses, all of which contribute to my stress. Therefore, I frequently listen to music on my mp3 player. I can enjoy music without being concerned about those around me. As a result, Music brings me happiness when I listen to it.\nAdditionally, exercise is another highly effective method for everyone to manage stress. Take my example: I constantly juggle numerous tasks, such as completing challenging work assignments on time. These issues sometimes make it difficult for me to fall asleep because they cause stress. Hence, I make it a habit to work out after my job, with jogging being my preferred exercise. Post-exercise, I find it easier to fall asleep. Exercise not only alleviates my stress but also enhances my overall health.\nMoreover, meditation is also an effective stress reduction technique. When I am overwhelmed with thoughts, leading to stress, I turn to meditation. Meditation provides a simple way to unwind since it doesn't require any tools and only takes a few minutes. My meditation practice involves sitting down, closing my eyes, and focusing on my breathing. These practices help in relieving my stress.\nIn summary, there are numerous methods to relieve stress. From my perspective, activities such as listening to music, exercising, and meditating are the most effective ways to combat stress. They are both simple and accessible.

Nonetheless, there is no logical basis in relying on luck to achieve one's objectives. Thus, I firmly support the notion that it is through dedicated effort that individuals reach their goals.\nTo begin with, placing all hopes solely on luck for success is highly precarious. Luck is a fleeting concept, with no assurance it will ever favor you. Should it fail, the letdown would be significant. Conversely, dedicated efforts propel you closer to achieving your desired outcomes. From my own experiences, my achievements have consistently been the result of hard work, rather than fortune. Additionally, I have never faced the frustration of unmet goals.\nMoreover, if you consider diligence as the cornerstone of achievement, it transforms you into a visionary. Simply put, those who value hard work have a clear vision of their objectives and understand their path. They meticulously plan their journey to success, continuously assessing their progress until the goal is reached. Believing solely in luck leaves you directionless. For instance, a friend facing financial difficulties habitually bought lottery tickets, hoping for a windfall. He was deluded into thinking this would resolve his monetary problems. Yet, to date, fortune has eluded him, worsening his situation. \nFurthermore, efforts might also attract luck, propelling you beyond your expected achievements. For example, my supervisor dedicated immense effort towards earning a promotion. He scrutinized every requirement needed to qualify for this advancement. He understood that obtaining a master's degree would enhance his qualifications over others. Even though despite numerous personal and professional obligations, he completed the degree in time. Ultimately, he not only secured the promotion amidst tough competition but was also nominated for an international scholarship, because his qualifications surpassed those of his peers. \nWhile being fortunate is beneficial, relying entirely on fortune is unwise.

Today, mastering at least one foreign language has become crucial, as most individuals engage with foreigners at some point in their lives, enhancing their skill set in the process. Furthermore, I believe it is more advantageous for individuals to learn a foreign language within their own country. The rationale behind this perspective is elaborated in the following sections.\nFirstly, not everyone has the opportunity to travel abroad for language learning because such an endeavor demands substantial financial resources and involves complex legal procedures. In the past, finding a tutor for foreign language instruction was challenging. However, globalization has made it easier to find language instructors domestically.

{"id": "id_20", "input": "In today's fast-paced and competitive world, it is undeniable that acquiring a wealth of knowledge and skills is essential to stand out and achieve success. Many believe that these aspects are primarily gained through academic institutions. To some extent, I align with this viewpoint. However, I am convinced that individuals can also excel without attending universities.\nPrimarily, university education is undeniably crucial for professions like doctors, engineers, and lawyers. Without adequate training and expertise, it would be impossible for them to excel in their careers. Furthermore, being at university offers them the chance to exchange knowledge and build networks for business partnerships. This networking can be advantageous when they plan to establish their own enterprises or medical practices.\nFrom another angle, there are numerous individuals who achieve great success in their domains without a university degree. Consider those who launch their own businesses. These entrepreneurs rely entirely on perseverance and fortune. Remarkably, for some, this path has proven to be quite lucrative. For instance, Michael Dell, the creator and CEO of Dell, departed college at the age of 19. Initially, he initiated his computer business from his college dormitory. Over time, he invested his earnings along with a family loan to advance to his current status.\nAdditionally, individuals with inherent talents are also highly likely to thrive in life. This holds particularly true in industries such as entertainment and sports. The rise of numerous reality shows has enabled fortunate individuals to succeed. To further illustrate, David Archuleta, once an unknown, has now captured the hearts of many. Consequently, it is clear that those with natural talents have a substantial chance of achieving success.\nIn conclusion, it is indeed true that higher education plays a vital role in one's journey to prosperity.

I align with this scientific perspective because only educators can empathize, connect with students, and serve as both mentors and role models.\nTo sum up, schools cannot exist without educators.

This is because the majority of their interactions are with fellow students. On the other hand, by doing part-time jobs, students can interact with a diverse range of individuals, mostly adults. Consequently, these individuals can impart valuable insights about adult life to students. My friend Lisa, who currently holds a part-time job, shares that the experience is incredibly rewarding. Through her part-time work, she has built friendships with various people who have exposed her to different facets of adult existence. For instance, Lisa initially believed that work was central to adult life; however, after meeting her new friends, she realized that responsibility, rather than work, is the true essence. As a result, with the insights provided by her new friends, she now feels more confident about her future adult life.\nSecondly, parents frequently remind students that adulthood is considerably more demanding than school life. However, since we haven't experienced it firsthand, it's challenging for us to truly grasp how stressful adult life can be. Thus, part-time work is necessary to teach us the rigors of real adult life. In fact, studies suggest that students who have held part-time jobs tend to manage their time effectively for future preparation and set more realistic expectations for their future compared to those who haven't. Consequently, part-time work can offer a deeper understanding of future life.\nThirdly, some parents worry that part-time work might interfere with students' academic performance. In reality, most students opt to work part-time during their holidays, so it does not affect their study. Compared to spending the holidays playing computer games, part-time work is the most beneficial option for students.\nIn conclusion, engaging in part-time work allows students to experience and learn more about genuine adult life.

Although industrial buildings are essential for modern societal progress, many individuals oppose the idea of having a factory close to their neighborhood due to pollution concerns. Personally, the benefits of constructing a factory will exceed its drawbacks, if we address the environmental challenges posed by factories.\nFirstly, a large factory has the potential to drive local economic growth and decrease unemployment. The production of goods necessitates a workforce, which allows local residents to gain employment. Additionally, factories are interconnected with other industries and businesses, spurring the economic development of the local area. For instance, the real estate sector will thrive to meet the accommodation needs of the workforce.\nThe primary drawback is pollution. Certain regions are experiencing severe repercussions due to excessive industrialization, including water contamination, traffic congestion, and health issues. For example, in various industrial cities, a significant number of workers suffer from respiratory issues, like asthma, which can be attributed to ash waste and specific chemicals.\nNevertheless, With societal progress, the construction of more factories is unavoidable. Consequently, addressing the drawbacks of factory construction is more crucial than deciding whether to construct them. In actuality, many issues can be prevented if factories make substantial efforts to effectively manage their waste.\nIn summary, the establishment of manufacturing plants is a hallmark of industrialization for numerous nations.

Exams are adaptable, with various question formats like multiple-choice and essays assessing different reasoning skills. However, there are also significant disadvantages associated with exams. Candidates who are skilled at taking tests might excel without possessing substantial knowledge or skills. In contrast, some individuals fail to achieve favorable outcomes due to test anxiety. In this case, educators and students may concentrate solely on curriculum segments expected to appear on exams, thus limiting the overall learning experience.\nSeveral strategies should be implemented to mitigate these issues. Wherever possible, examinations should align with the content and activities within the learning context. Exam formats should be diverse to ensure equal chances for individuals with varying skill sets. Alternative assessment methods, such as assignments for evaluating independent learning and research skills or group projects for assessing teamwork, should be explored.\nIn conclusion, it is convincing that exams play a crucial role in providing an accurate and unbiased measurement of academic accomplishments.

{"id": "id_30", "input": "Criminal acts inevitably lead to consequences. Retribution serves as a measure against offenders. Some nations enforce severe penalties, including the death penalty, while others offer more leniency in their legal systems. Nonetheless, stringent laws, such as the death penalty, are crucial in a community.\nThe death penalty is reserved for the 'rarest of the rare' instances. Its primary aim is to ensure the safety of other individuals. When an offender poses a societal threat by potentially committing atrocious acts, they are sentenced to capital punishment. Therefore, the death penalty shields society from hardened criminals.\nFurthermore, Capital punishment deters both the motivation and the likelihood of other malicious offenses. Aware of the severity of the punishment, individuals with criminal intent may be deterred from committing such acts. Consequently, there is a significant reduction in crime and violence rates.\nSignificantly, The death penalty reduces government expenditure that would otherwise be spent on maintaining these dangerous offenders. Those criminals beyond rehabilitation or with a history of similar crimes are consequently given the death penalty.\nHowever, jurors delivering the verdict are, after all, human. They hold the power over a person's life. They are susceptible to errors which could occasionally implicate an innocent person or a criminal affected by circumstances. Thus, jurors should carefully consider the context of the crime. For instance, for example, if someone commits murder in self-defense, it should not be considered a heinous crime. Only those who consciously commit such deplorable acts are subjected to the death penalty.\nThe death penalty is vital for maintaining societal order. I strongly assert that individuals like psychopaths, terrorists, or any criminal devoid of empathy for human life warrant the death penalty.

Yet, there are individuals who don't favor this narrative. Personally, I enjoy witnessing the deserving individuals being rewarded. Nevertheless, I don't believe it's suitable for good characters to consistently experience happy endings.\nTo begin with, having similar conclusions for every story can lead to monotony. Predictability arises when good characters perpetually triumph. Our interest in such stories diminishes. Conversely, when good characters don't always prevail, our curiosity propels us to finish the story. For instance, Hollywood narratives typically conclude with a hero overcoming adversity and winning love. However, many viewers, myself included, have grown weary of this. I am tired of witnessing the same type of conclusion repeatedly. Therefore, it's not feasible for virtuous characters to always receive rewards in films or television.\nIn reality, even good individuals sometimes face unfortunate outcomes.

Furthermore, the portrayal of all products as superior leads to confusion among consumers when selecting the most appropriate items. For instance, certain shampoos, such as Sunsilk, Clear, and Dove, are depicted as miraculous solutions for repairing damaged hair, along with numerous other benefits.

Additionally, advertising assists consumers in becoming familiar with companies and thoroughly understanding the products they offer. Consider Coca-Cola as an example, this beverage company is renowned for investing a substantial portion of its budget in advertising. It is unsurprising that this brand has become increasingly recognizable to customers worldwide. Finally, online advertising is among the most accessible methods due to its benefits like lower costs, convenience, and easy monitoring.\nIn conclusion, every aspect has its positives and negatives, and advertising is no exception.

Nonetheless, the field of journalism is undergoing changes. A number of journalists prioritize gossip over news that pertains to societal matters, focusing excessively on celebrities' private lives.\nTo begin with, gossip involves deceptive imagery aimed at boosting newspaper circulation or stirring public sentiment. The audience might encounter numerous images in such reports, which seem to narrate a tale. Additionally, it is unjust that the absurd coverage can be bothersome to the celebrities being reported on.\nAlso, sensationalism diverts attention from societal or public concerns. Media executives face the challenge of selecting content that captivates the audience. Therefore, these reports on celebrities' private lives, containing trivial or distorted information, do not address societal issues.

{"id": "id_37", "input": "In today's world, many argue that participating in classroom sessions offers numerous advantages for students, providing them with diverse learning opportunities. Contrary to this widely held belief, there are still individuals who maintain that having the option to attend classes allows students to study at home, thereby saving time spent on commuting and reducing expenses. Nonetheless, I lean towards the notion that attending classes appears to be a more sensible choice.\nFirstly, I firmly hold that being in class offers students the chance to engage with peers, aiding in the comprehension of new material by discussing them during breaks at college. Additionally, students can support one another in better understanding the materials. On the other hand, if students skip classes, they miss out on peer assistance for grasping challenging concepts. \nAnother crucial aspect to consider is that teachers' guidance enables students to grasp concepts more swiftly and effortlessly because teachers provide detailed explanations in class and follow up with numerous examples to clarify points. Thus, attending classes not only optimizes time but also enhances the learning process, making it quicker compared to self-study. \nMoreover, being present in class instills a sense of responsibility in students as students must adhere to classroom rules and develop perseverance in completing assignments. Yet, those who opt for home study lack structured discipline and struggle to set consistent study times. Consequently, such disorganized and fragmented study may lead to missing crucial information. \nConsidering the aforementioned points, I am convinced that interacting and learning with peers is an effective method for mastering materials.

{"id": "id_38", "input": "What comes to mind when you admire a stunning building? Or when you gaze at an airport? Do you believe these structures were built by mere happenstance? Certainly not. It's equally absurd to think that internet giants like Google and Yahoo emerged by sheer coincidence. While some individuals attribute success to luck, I must admit, I disagree with that notion. Let me present my main arguments here. \nTo start off, notable individuals are typically hardworking rather than simply fortunate. Diligence transforms you into a skilled professional who excels in their field. In other words, through dedicated effort, you minimize the influence of luck in your achievements. For instance, in soccer, it's often said that scoring from a penalty kick requires some luck. Statistically, the odds of scoring are fifty-fifty. However, I believe Ronaldo has a higher likelihood of scoring a penalty than I do. It's not because Ronaldo is luckier than I am. It's undoubtedly because he trains and practices more than I do. He dedicates time to training on the football field daily, thus it's not due to him being more fortunate than I am.\nAdditionally, relying solely on luck for success is not a viable strategy. While I acknowledge luck's role in success, it seldom stays with us. Take, for example, when preparing for the TOEFL or similar multiple-choice tests with four options. You cannot rely exclusively on luck without studying, even if you're exceptionally lucky. Randomly selecting answers will likely lead to failure. Without doubt, The smart approach is to study diligently to succeed in exams.\nLastly, Effort and learning are essential to acquiring the necessary knowledge to execute projects effectively. Even the luckiest individuals can't build a car or construct a skyscraper by chance alone. These feats are accomplished by those who have mastered their craft. Certainly, such individuals work hard and gain immense experience through their efforts.\nIn conclusion, I believe significant achievements demand substantial effort, not mere luck, although luck plays a role in achieving goals, still its effect is superficial, and we shouldn't depend on luck in our strategies.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay257", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 417, "to": 491}], "label": "Claim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 493, "to": 571}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 589, "to": 670}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 686, "to": 764}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 766, "to": 816}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 818, "to": 899}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 901, "to": 946}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 948, "to": 1011}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1013, "to": 1070}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1077, "to": 1127}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1143, "to": 1202}], "label": "Claim", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1204, "to": 1271}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1292, "to": 1371}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1373, "to": 1461}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1463, "to": 1517}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1534, "to": 1595}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1605, "to": 1707}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1709, "to": 1798}], "label": "Claim", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1800, "to": 1867}], "label": "Premise", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1880, "to": 1956}], "label": "Premise", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1983, "to": 2048}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 20}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2059, "to": 2095}], "label": "Claim", "id": 21}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2103, "to": 2179}], "label": "Premise", "id": 22}], "edges": [{"source": 0, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 0, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 0, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 5, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 3, "target": 6, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 17, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 17, "target": 18, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 17, "target": 19, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 21, "target": 22, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 10, 17, 20, 21]}
{"id": "id_39", "input": "In our daily interactions, we meet various individuals and receive different feedback about ourselves or our efforts, whether it's praise or criticism. While compliments are often easy to accept, criticism can be challenging. This is why it's essential to understand that those who cannot handle criticism from others will struggle to succeed in collaborative environments. Personally, I agree with this notion.\nTo begin with, the essence of teamwork lies in achieving \"consensus\". This means that everyone's input is valuable. In collaborative settings, team members come together to brainstorm, evaluate various solutions, and ultimately reach a consensus. During the extensive discussions that characterize group work, diverse opinions are bound to emerge. The process falters if a member stubbornly clings to their ideas and disregards feedback from others because the project is a collective endeavor, not a solo performance. It's incumbent upon each member to honor and consider others' perspectives.\nMoreover, Embracing criticism is an admirable quality as it involves acknowledging opposing viewpoints. Even outside of group settings, one must remain open to criticism. Criticism can be painful because it highlights your weaknesses and compels you to address them. Nevertheless, constructive criticism can help you identify and rectify flaws, provided you are receptive to it. Individuals who dismiss all feedback risk missing opportunities for self-improvement. Simply put, if you're unable to accept criticism, not only will you struggle in collaborative efforts, but you'll also face challenges in solo projects. As a Chinese proverb states: \"Good medicine tastes bitter\". Criticism may be the most effective remedy for personal growth.\nYet, some might wonder: what if the critique is incorrect? What if I was initially right but the seemingly plausible criticism misled me? Isn't persistence a valuable trait, too? In my view, even when you're correct, criticism remains beneficial because in such scenarios, it not only acts as a corrective measure but also tests your understanding of your work. Receiving criticism doesn't mean accepting it wholesale. You should also apply your own discernment! And skillfully leveraging criticism is an art.\nTo sum up, criticism is crucial, particularly in teamwork, but it remains valuable even in other contexts. Criticism is like a discerning mirror that allows us to see our flaws and strive to improve, becoming more beautiful and self-assured.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay251", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 272, "to": 372}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 427, "to": 480}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 482, "to": 526}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 528, "to": 657}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 760, "to": 860}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 869, "to": 929}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 931, "to": 1005}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1017, "to": 1109}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1111, "to": 1176}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1178, "to": 1202}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1211, "to": 1272}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1288, "to": 1384}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1386, "to": 1470}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1484, "to": 1623}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1625, "to": 1683}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1685, "to": 1747}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1940, "to": 1994}], "label": "Claim", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2003, "to": 2109}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2111, "to": 2166}], "label": "Premise", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2168, "to": 2210}], "label": "Premise", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2212, "to": 2257}], "label": "Premise", "id": 20}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2270, "to": 2364}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 21}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 8, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 11, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 16, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 16, "target": 18, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 16, "target": 19, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 16, "target": 20, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 8, 16, 21]}

Our district's current high school is quite outdated and lacks essential resources for students, hindering their educational experience. I strongly feel that a new high school is a valuable enhancement to our community's educational framework.\nTo begin with, I believe that the new high school will provide numerous opportunities for students focused on learning. The existing high school is significantly aged and requires new educational materials and renovations for sports facilities. Additionally, the physics and chemistry labs are in poor condition, so students struggle to learn effectively during classes. They will study with renewed vigor and enthusiasm at the new school.\nMoreover, the new high school will serve as a hub for forming new connections among students from various communities and districts in the city. After school hours, students and others will gather at the high school building to participate in various competitions. For example, during football matches, students from different high schools will attend and maintain contact after the events. This will enhance the students' social networks. The sole drawback is the noise generated by the competitions.

{"id": "id_41", "input": "The role of education frequently sparks debate among individuals and within society, particularly at higher levels such as college or university. While some believe that every student should have access to education at this tier, I personally think that it is more effective to reserve this level of learning for a select group of proficient, knowledgeable students.\nTo begin with, prioritizing gifted students is a more advantageous approach because this strategy aids academic institutions in sustaining their high standards of education. Unlike higher education, middle school and high school require far less ability and skills to manage the extensive and complex knowledge presented. In reality, some students excel in high schools, yet the rigor of higher education poses challenges even for the talented ones. This is why higher education should be exclusive to a select few, as broadening access could be detrimental to institutions, since they might need to simplify the curriculum to make it feasible for a wider audience.\nMoreover, universities should enroll only exceptional students because this results in superior human resources for complex tasks. Some contend that this approach might cause 'social division', where those with advanced education decline to perform so-called 'low jobs', yet in truth it poses no threat to the community at large. Standard jobs will remain accessible to all, while intricate ones should be managed by top individuals, who commence their careers at leading institutions. I feel that restricting admissions to universities is a wise decision as this incentivizes students to strive for excellence, maintaining them at challenging levels of learning and fostering self-improvement. Ultimately, this enhances the overall quality of education and provides society with the most capable individuals for crucial roles.\nIn summary, I support the idea that compulsory education should be enforced through high school, but further divisions should be reserved for the most capable students.

Data from the International Animal Preserving Association reveals that only ten percent of animal species that have ever existed still remain, indicating that our planet's biodiversity is critically at risk. Additionally, the increase in sea levels due to global warming poses a serious threat to human life in numerous countries. Continuing to emit carbon dioxide through non-eco-friendly vehicles could result in countries like Japan being submerged, and alter weather patterns, leading to floods, droughts, and more frequent destructive storms. In essence, our ecosystem is deteriorating at an unprecedented rate, and if we fail to implement drastic measures now, we might never do so.\nMoreover, investing in environmental protection will eventually be advantageous for the company. These days, there is a growing public focus on conservation; thus, supporting conservation efforts serves as a more effective advertising strategy. Consider if your company's sponsored initiative leads to significant environmental improvements, it would enhance the company's reputation as eco-conscious and reap benefits in this consumer-driven market.\nLastly, environmental conservation elevates our standard of living.

Effective advertisements can persuade individuals that they desire something, even if it doesn't align with society's actual needs.

Adults, who are concerned about managing disposable income, are less likely to make impulsive purchases. many of them need to budget their money when making additional purchases. Conversely, children and teenagers, who lack financial independence, are more prone to impulsive buying without assessing their actual needs, because they are not burdened by financial responsibilities and may not fully grasp what is necessary.\nFrom my perspective, I believe purchasing habits are a personal choice and are not entirely dictated by advertisements.

{"id": "id_48", "input": "In recent years, most developed nations have witnessed low saving rates as individuals choose to immediately spend their income or even borrow money to cover their costs. However, isn't it wiser to set aside funds for future investments or unforeseen challenges? Personally, setting aside a portion of your income is crucial because the future is unpredictable in both your career and personal life, and savings can help achieve some of your aspirations.\nTo begin with, there are numerous uncertainties regarding your career path. Today's global economic climate is challenging, with many unforeseen elements making it essential to have some funds in your bank account. For example, I recall several friends who recently lost their jobs due to the European economic downturn. A number of them had no personal savings. They were unable to pay their rent, so they had to return to live with their families, losing their independence.\nMoreover, the trajectory of your personal life is uncertain. In the future, you might face unavoidable costs that savings could help cover. During my university days, I remember a friend who had limited savings and faced a major car repair. He couldn't manage the repair expenses, so he had to sell the car.\nLastly, savings enable you to purchase luxury items and achieve your dreams. Putting in hard work and saving for future investments brings a sense of accomplishment and allows you to reward yourself. As an illustration, Last summer, I embarked on a month-long backpacking journey through Southeast Asia with my girlfriend. Our savings were essential for realizing our long-held dream.\nTaking into account all the arguments mentioned above, in my opinion, saving money over time is the only viable option.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay302", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 275, "to": 324}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 333, "to": 453}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 470, "to": 529}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 531, "to": 668}], "label": "Claim", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 683, "to": 774}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 818, "to": 852}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 857, "to": 930}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 942, "to": 991}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 993, "to": 1070}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1072, "to": 1171}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1173, "to": 1211}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1216, "to": 1238}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1248, "to": 1315}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1317, "to": 1438}], "label": "Claim", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1460, "to": 1561}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1563, "to": 1623}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1695, "to": 1743}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 16}], "edges": [{"source": 3, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 13, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 13, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 13, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 3, 8, 13, 16]}
{"id": "id_49", "input": "While some individuals argue that the bulk of a school schedule should be fully focused on academic subjects, I am convinced that physical education should not be marginalized. Engaging in physical activities promotes a healthier population, enhances learning through firsthand experience, and ultimately supports economic growth. \nTo begin with, an old Latin saying goes: \"Anima sana in corpore sano,\" which translates to a healthy body underpins a healthy mind. There is a clear connection between individual health and the regularity of physical activity. The more we engage in physical activities, the better our well-being. Furthermore, it is evident that consistent physical activity can enhance health over time, gradually improving our physical condition. Thus, if the entire population starts engaging in sports from school age and continues daily, it could foster a healthier nation.\nIn addition, engaging in both indoor and outdoor sports clarifies many aspects. For instance, when someone jogs daily, they eventually gain insights into their body through self-observation. Similarly, a school basketball team learns more about executing specific shots through practice rather than theoretical study. Moreover, almost all breakthroughs in natural sciences were achieved through direct observation, an element of physical education. \nFinally, a region's economic stability largely hinges on the health of its residents. For example, investing in physical education programs can reduce healthcare expenditures, because the population is relatively healthy. Alongside this, individuals with good physical health are capable of contributing more significantly to both economic and social progress. In fact, a person who feels well has a more efficient brain. Consequently, emphasizing physical activities from an early age can ultimately create a society that is mentally sound. As a result, it results in a nation that is economically competitive.\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize that the more focus given to the issue of physical education, the greater the impact on students' academic achievements.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay011", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 130, "to": 175}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 177, "to": 329}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 423, "to": 462}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 464, "to": 557}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 559, "to": 627}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 642, "to": 762}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 770, "to": 892}], "label": "Claim", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 907, "to": 972}], "label": "Claim", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 988, "to": 1083}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1096, "to": 1210}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1222, "to": 1341}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1353, "to": 1428}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1443, "to": 1518}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1528, "to": 1564}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1582, "to": 1703}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1714, "to": 1764}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1780, "to": 1884}], "label": "Claim", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1899, "to": 1954}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2002, "to": 2116}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 18}], "edges": [{"source": 6, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 16, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 16, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 16, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 6, 7, 11, 16, 18]}

Essentially, tourist attractions are often situated in remote areas where the economy had not flourished prior to their development. It is only after investment by companies that chains of hotels and services emerge. This inevitably draws substantial attention, resulting in significant income for local inhabitants. In other words, tourism redirects the local economy towards its optimal path, maximizing its inherent potential.\nSecondly, although some environmental harm is unavoidable, tourism is not the culprit. To transform a wilderness into a tourist spot, planners must have carefully considered the preservation of the landscape. Specifically, for example, a substantial amount is spent on pruning trees, watering plants, and maintaining the balance of local wildlife and flora, aiming to enhance the natural beauty. Moreover, ecotourism, an environmentally friendly service, supports environmentalists and nature enthusiasts in raising awareness about protecting coexisting species. As a result, tourism should not be accused of being infamous for harming ecological diversity.\nIn summary, tourism has shown its positive approach towards exploited areas, both financially and environmentally.

Nonetheless, there are concerns that industrialized nations might achieve their economic ambitions at the cost of harming the environment. In my view, I believe strong economies can coexist with environmental conservation.\nCertainly, certain nations might prioritize economic growth over environmental conservation, leading to environmental degradation. Since these underprivileged countries lack sufficient financial and human capital, cutting-edge technologies, and know-how, they must depend on natural resources to sustain their living standards. Additionally, people living in impoverished regions often do not possess the knowledge to protect ecosystems. Consequently, unregulated and careless exploitation of local resources might occur, putting pressure on natural reserves. From this perspective, economic growth and environmental conservation can be at odds.\nOn the contrary, I am convinced economic prosperity can be strongly connected to environmental protection. As people become more aware of sustainable economies, pollutant-free products are gaining popularity among consumers, suggesting that eco-friendly businesses can attract customers today, boosting sales. For instance, electric bicycles powered by sustainable energy sources have gained popularity in recent years.\nMoreover, considering environmental impacts seriously can improve workplace efficiency. An environmentally responsible company might optimize resource use to enhance its production processes and equipment, thereby increasing productivity. Therefore, it might accelerate economic growth. Conversely, without environmental preservation mandates, a company might continue to use significant energy, which forms a substantial part of its operational expenses, hindering economic progress.\nIn conclusion, I would assert that economic growth and environmental conservation can be mutually advanced.

Conversely, some argue that these students might interfere with their academic pursuits and should be permitted to leave school early to pursue employment. Personally, I am inclined to support the viewpoint that students must be compelled to pursue education at school.\nFirstly, schools provide students with an excellent environment featuring seasoned educators and high-quality study programs. This establishes optimal conditions for student learning and can encourage them to concentrate on their academic responsibilities rather than frittering away time on unproductive activities. Secondly, educational institutions impart a wealth of academic knowledge to students. Students have the opportunity to acquire professional skills, broaden their perspectives, and accumulate valuable experiences. Consequently, they stand a better chance of securing employment and achieving success in the future. For instance, it is commonly understood that employers consistently favor hiring candidates with higher qualifications and professional competencies.\nNonetheless, it's not entirely unreasonable for some to believe that children should pause their academic endeavors and seek employment. While children can learn extensively at school, there are numerous subjects that may hold minimal relevance for them in the future. Additionally, children can develop social skills through employment. They can gain experiences that are unavailable in the school setting. Working fosters independence in children and teaches them to appreciate and manage their earnings.\nIn conclusion, I am of the opinion that students ought to pursue their education within the school environment.

{"id": "id_59", "input": "Smoking can provide individuals with significant pleasure and relaxation. Nevertheless, one should not encourage smoking at the expense of others' well-being. In this regard, I support the notion that smoking should be banned in restaurants and other public areas, and we ought to advocate for state laws to enforce this prohibition because smoking not only harms the ambiance of the restaurant but also poses a potential health risk to others.\nTo begin with, although it may be deemed excessive to claim that smoking should be banned everywhere in society, smoking in a restaurant is viewed as disregarding the health of others while enjoying oneself, it is widely accepted that second-hand smoke emitted from the smoker poses an even greater risk to the health of those nearby than to the smoker themselves. For instance, if just one individual lights up in a restaurant, everyone else involuntarily inhales the smoke, putting their health in jeopardy. This is due to the fact that certain burned substances in a cigarette can rapidly harm a person's respiratory system once inhaled. Consequently, smoking in restaurants should be completely outlawed because it turns the restaurant into a contaminated environment, endangering the health of all patrons.\nMoreover, even if some patrons are indifferent to the dangers posed by second-hand smoke, the unpleasant smoke can significantly diminish their appetite, effectively ruining their dining experience. The smoker's exhaled smoke often causes discomfort or revulsion among others, negatively impacting their dining mood. This can, in turn, reduce the restaurant's appeal to patrons because fewer people are inclined to visit due to their negative dining experiences. \nFinally, smoking offers no benefits to the smoker themselves. It not only damages their health, increasing their vulnerability to respiratory illnesses, but also harms their public image and reputation. This is particularly relevant when the smoker is a well-known political figure or a celebrity, because many regard smoking in restaurants as a rude behavior. At this juncture, the general public may perceive the smoker as lacking basic manners, deeming them unsuitable for public leadership. \nIn conclusion, smoking in a restaurant is both harmful and disrespectful.

The era when women were confined to monotonous housework and child-rearing is long gone. Today, women are much more dynamic; they can be successful entrepreneurs, engage in politics, become scientists, and much more. In other words, the so-called \"weaker\" gender possesses the right and capability to contribute to human advancement just like men, and in some areas, they even excel.\nSecondly, the shift in women's rights has yielded numerous benefits not only for them but also for society. For example, the financial strain on families has lessened considerably with both spouses contributing financially.

{"id": "id_66", "input": "The question of whether universities should allocate funds towards enhancing facilities rather than hiring renowned educators is a subject of intense debate, offering multiple perspectives due to its intricacy. Some individuals advocate for investment in upgrading facilities, while others argue that having famous teachers benefits students more. After contemplating this issue thoroughly, I have formed my own viewpoint. I favor the former; in other words, I believe investing in enhancing facilities is more beneficial. \nThe primary reason for this preference stems from an undeniable fact that having more advanced facilities increases our opportunities to expand knowledge. For instance, a library serves as an excellent environment for students to study and conduct research. Students can focus on their studies in a quiet setting, with plenty of resources available for reference. This convenient and multifaceted facility enhances students' learning experiences. Consequently, we can begin to concur that certain facilities offer significant advantages to students. \nAdditionally, another important factor is that students do not spend all their time in classrooms. They engage in numerous activities at school. Consider a scenario where a student is part of a school jazz ensemble. Such a student would require a superior auditorium for an exceptional performance. This outstanding performance would provide the student with a memorable and meaningful experience. Therefore, from this scenario, we can assert that students would prefer schools to invest in improving facilities.\nAdmittedly, there are those who might argue that funds should be directed towards hiring distinguished teachers because these teachers are capable of imparting knowledge effectively. However, based on my understanding, I question the reliability of this assertion due to its rashness. A student's success is not solely dependent on having a good teacher but is largely determined by their own study efforts. Hiring a highly acclaimed teacher is futile if the students are unmotivated. \nConsidering the reasons outlined above, I maintain that enhancing facilities is the optimal approach for schools because the benefits of improving facilities outweigh those of other options. In simpler terms, students gain more advantages from superior facilities.

Therefore, historical evidence shows that education broadens one's knowledge and experience, preparing them for the realities of the workplace through college subjects. Based on this perspective, providing equal educational opportunities for both genders is imperative.\nIn summary, there is a critical need to foster skill development and obtain degree certifications for career growth, applicable to all genders.

{"id": "id_71", "input": "Nowadays, the increasing unemployment rate has sparked significant discussions. Some individuals argue that the optimal approach to tackle this issue is by equipping the jobless with smartphones that connect to the Internet. They assert that this is the most suitable use of public funds. However, I concur with this idea only partially because I believe that handing out mobile phones to the unemployed is a complete misuse of financial resources.\nFrom a favorable perspective, if individuals without employment possess smartphones with Internet access, they can explore the web for more job prospects. For instance, they can navigate The Star Online's job section to discover a position that suits them. Utilizing the Internet, they can also conduct thorough research on the jobs they find and learn how to prepare themselves for these roles. Additionally, the phones can be employed to contact companies they aspire to work for. In summary, if the government supplies smartphones to the jobless, they can secure employment to support themselves.\nOn the other hand, considering an alternative viewpoint, distributing smartphones to the unemployed represents a misuse of taxpayers' money. This stems from the fact that funds diverted from providing electronic devices can be allocated to more beneficial initiatives for the nation. To further illustrate, the money could be used to develop more public facilities or be given to those in need to assist them in earning a livelihood. In conclusion, the funds could be directed towards alternative objectives rather than distributing smartphones to the unemployed.\nMoreover, the offer of free smartphones might lead many to exploit this opportunity. It would not be surprising if individuals declare themselves jobless just to acquire a smartphone. Some could even falsely claim unemployment to qualify for these phones. In this scenario, public funds are squandered ineffectively. Furthermore, thus far, there is no evidence or surveys confirming the effectiveness of this approach in lowering unemployment rates.\nIn essence, the proposal of providing internet-enabled smartphones to the jobless is neither an appropriate nor the most effective strategy to reduce unemployment. I advise that the government thoroughly examine the backgrounds of individuals before distributing smartphones to them.

{"id": "id_72", "input": "The surge in population leads to increased demands for transportation. Many nations have long endured pollution, noise, and accidents. From my viewpoint, enhancing roads and highways is the most viable solution to these issues due to three significant reasons.\nFirst and foremost, it's widely acknowledged that upgrading public transportation will likely exacerbate pollution and increase accidents. Vehicles like buses, cars, and trains frequently release harmful gases contributing to severe illnesses like lung cancer and pneumonia. Additionally, the noise generated from engines can impair our hearing. Most crucially, numerous accidents occur on the roadways. For instance, in my nation, buses are often blamed for the sharp rise in accident rates. Annually, Vietnam sees about twelve thousand fatalities from accidents annually, akin to the death toll from the tsunami in Japan.\nSecondly, investing in road and highway infrastructure can expand the space and accommodate more public transportation. This allows not only buses but also personal vehicles to navigate the roads with ease. For example, I always leave school when everyone floods the streets, rushing home. It is quite challenging to break free from the crowded roads within just an hour. On the other hand, if the roads are widened, it would enable people to reach home quickly with minimal collisions. \nLastly, allocating funds to refurbish highways and roads can enhance their quality. We all dread traveling on uneven roads filled with potholes. These poor conditions lead to many serious accidents and cause anxiety among people. Blaming drivers for accidents is unwarranted because some of the accountability lies with the authorities. Moreover, a smooth road surface enhances the safety and ease of transportation.\nTo sum up, the benefits of road improvements mentioned earlier are completely persuasive and essential.

In my view, governments should definitely prioritize funding the public transportation system because it would address the issues arising from the increasing number of private vehicles.\nTo begin with, using public transit minimizes the resources consumed for transportation. Cars rely on gasoline, which is a finite resource. Consequently, the higher the number of cars, the quicker our gasoline reserves diminish. Conversely, when public transport is used effectively, the gasoline consumption per individual significantly decreases. And this undeniably contributes to the preservation of our precious natural resource, gasoline.\nSecondly, public transportation contributes to alleviating air pollution. On average, public transport consumes substantially less gasoline for passenger transport compared to private cars. This implies that by opting for public transport, there is a reduction in gas emissions, leading to less polluted air and less congested roads filled with exhaust fumes.\nFinally, opting for public transit is considerably safer than using private vehicles. According to the National Safety Council, taking a bus is over 170 times safer than traveling by private car. Hence, there is no reason for governments to refrain from investing in public transport, which is a healthy, safe, and cost-effective means of travel.\nIn conclusion, I am convinced that allocating funds to enhance public transportation is essential because it is vital for safeguarding our planet and fostering a healthy, safe living environment.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay198", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 219, "to": 300}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 309, "to": 391}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 408, "to": 480}], "label": "Claim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 482, "to": 531}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 547, "to": 620}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 634, "to": 740}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 746, "to": 836}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 848, "to": 910}], "label": "Claim", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 924, "to": 1026}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1028, "to": 1196}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1207, "to": 1282}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1284, "to": 1392}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1401, "to": 1543}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1580, "to": 1642}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1651, "to": 1739}], "label": "Claim", "id": 14}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 7, 12, 13, 14]}

Consequently, encouraging physical inactivity to enhance children's skills is not advisable.\nTo start with, classic teaching methods have been scientifically validated and are considered the best way to educate children. while technology and its advances have positively impacted education to some extent. However, the essential role of teachers in classrooms remains unchanged. The fact that students today often complete their homework and research on computers instead of visiting libraries, illustrating this point. However, screens cannot substitute the presence of educators because their expertise and flexibility are invaluable. Hence, teachers cannot be replaced by inanimate screens.\nSecondly, watching television is a passive activity and increasing time spent on it should not be encouraged. Conversely, children who engage in activities that foster creativity, collaboration, and competition generally perform better overall. For example, an experiment showed that children who experienced diverse outdoor activities outperformed those who mainly watched documentaries in differentiating types of plants or animals. Therefore, such activities can provide children with vital skills beneficial for their future careers.\nIn summary, despite the understanding that some children find learning through TV effective, children should never be encouraged to partake in such passive activities. schools have been using traditional teaching methods for generations.

{"id": "id_75", "input": "The debate over whether direct communication is superior to other forms is a contentious one, and given the intricacies of this topic, it can be examined from multiple perspectives. While some individuals are inclined to view in-person interaction as the ultimate form of communication, others hold contrasting views. After careful contemplation, I have formed my own opinion. I align with the former viewpoint; specifically, I concur that face-to-face communication is preferable. \nForemost among the reasons is the undeniable reality that personal interaction can hold greater persuasive power. At times, face-to-face conversation can effectively persuade or voice complaints, as demonstrated by my uncle. He once raised a complaint about a restaurant's service. Without any embellishment, he approached the owner directly and pointed out that there was an issue with the meal\u2014a fly was hidden within it. Following this encounter, my uncle was provided with improved service, thanks to direct communication. Had he merely written a complaint online or contacted them by phone, I doubt the issue would have been given due importance. Consequently, we can begin to acknowledge that face-to-face interaction is the most effective method. \nBesides the aforementioned point, another equally significant factor is that without direct interaction, deception becomes more likely. For example, I received hurtful messages from my close friend, Eric, on Facebook. He claimed that I had completely failed in maintaining a good friendship and wanted to sever ties. I was taken aback and couldn't comprehend the situation. Ultimately, I discovered that his Facebook account had been hacked. Thus, based on this scenario, we can affirm the significance of face-to-face communication. \nOf course, there are those who argue that communication through letters, emails, or phone calls allows individuals to speak freely, which is an essential aspect of communication. Nonetheless, from my perspective, I question the validity of that assertion. It is plausible that before engaging in conversation, one should exercise caution with their words. Speaking without restraint is not crucial to communication; rather, it often proves harmful. \nWith the reasons outlined above, I favor expressing my views in person because the benefits of this approach outweigh those of the alternative. Simply put, I believe the most effective form of communication is face-to-face. This does not mean that alternative perspectives lack value entirely.

Consequently, criminals today are highly sophisticated and invest significant sums in acquiring advanced weaponry to confront law enforcement and fulfill their illicit objectives. Therefore, people in such communities may be inadvertently shot by both police officers and criminals. Furthermore, during their duty, not only do private citizens suffer, but infrastructures such as vehicles, homes, and streets are prone to damage from gunfire. Hence, a society in which the police carry firearms is undoubtedly perceived as extremely violent.\nSecondly, the police carry firearms only in societies plagued by high crime rates. As a result, individuals and law enforcement in these areas frequently encounter perilous types of crime, including theft, robbery, murder, rape, vandalism, and arson. Clearly, These are potentially the most compelling indicators of a community grappling with intense violence.\nIn summary, based on the aforementioned viewpoints, although arming police with guns is essential, it will escalate the level of violence.

{"id": "id_77", "input": "Everyone has their own preferred learning style. Personally, I believe learning independently and with a teacher can both be advantageous. Having a teacher can help avoid confusion and accelerate the learning process. Moreover, for hands-on subjects, the guidance of a teacher is essential. Conversely, there are times when I prefer to study alone.\nAn experienced teacher can make learning quicker and simpler for me. When tackling a challenging and obscure course on my own, I often feel disheartened after investing significant effort. In such scenarios, I seek assistance from a teacher.

For instance, Skills like driving, medical professions, engineering, and sports such as skiing and swimming necessitate finding a teacher. Mastering these independently is nearly impossible and ineffective. Incidentally, self-taught learners might misunderstand or misinterpret concepts! For example, Based on my experiences, I developed bad habits in guitar playing when self-taught, but corrected them with a tutor, enabling proper play.\nThere are topics I prefer to explore without a teacher due to this saves on tutoring fees and efficient use of time without the need for attending classes.

Nevertheless, this assumption is far more complex in practice. \nIn reality, strict gun regulations fail to effectively reduce crime and violence due to the fact that the majority of gun-related violence involves weapons that were acquired through illegal channels. individuals determined to engage in criminal activities or dominate communities through gang-related violence will continue to access firearms, irrespective of regulatory measures. \nFurthermore, in every society, there will always be individuals, whether law enforcement officers or civilians, who do not adhere to the law. This highlights that violence stems from the mindset of the perpetrator, not the tools they use. Consequently, governments aiming to tackle criminal activity should prioritize influencing their citizens' behavior over regulating the firearms involved in violent acts. \nIn conclusion, it becomes clear that there is a weak correlation between police carrying firearms and an increase in violence.

Consequently, those receiving significant paychecks must have surpassed others and accomplished remarkable feats in some manner. Their remuneration is not without reason. In our competitive world, proving one's excellence is necessary to persuade employers of one's worth for higher compensation. This principle applies universally across all professions.

Many of us only see the opulent lifestyle of affluent athletes, overlooking the hardships they've endured and the substantial investment they've made in themselves. They deserve to benefit from these high earnings. Put simply, if they aren't compensated sufficiently to match their performance, we might miss out on such inspiring displays. \nSome might contend that the disparity between wealthy athletes and the average person is enormous, seemingly unjust.

Typically, the focus is not on the functionality or quality of the products themselves, but rather on promoting the positive feeling associated with owning them. In other words, large companies enlist celebrities to represent their products. Featuring popular singers in commercials for items like motorcycles or clothing, for instance, leads to a significant boost in sales because young people, who are the target consumers, adore celebrities. Given that owning these products signifies their social status, the quality is evidently not of primary importance.\nNonetheless, even though advertisements can be misleading and exaggerated, it is equally true that they play a vital role in the economy.

While some individuals hold onto the belief that print media can endure for a long time, others argue that newspapers have lost their competitive edge to ensure their prolonged survival. Personally, I tend to agree with the latter perspective for the following reasons.\nFirst and foremost, accessing information via the internet is faster and more convenient than through newspapers. Unlike in the past, when individuals had to wait hours for the day's newspaper, today they can receive the latest news updates every second on their smartphones or computers with internet access, anytime and anywhere. Clearly, these devices are ubiquitous across the globe, making it simple for individuals to access a wealth of information that newspapers cannot fit into a few pages. Therefore, print media has lost its crucial role in delivering information.\nAdditionally, economically speaking, purchasing newspapers seems unnecessary when the internet is readily available to everyone. It is evident that internet services are offered at minimal cost or even free in numerous countries. This raises the question of whether an individual would spend extra money on newspapers to obtain the same, or often less, information than what is accessible online. The likely response is that rational individuals would seldom make such a choice. Thus, the readership of newspapers is likely to continue declining sharply, potentially resulting in numerous closures in the near future.\nLastly, but certainly not least, considering the environmental impact, it must be acknowledged that increased newspaper production leads to more deforestation. This directly contributes to the global deforestation crisis occurring today. At this juncture, newspaper production will inevitably confront challenges from environmentalists as it strives to continue.\nIn summary, it may be disheartening for newspaper advocates to witness the decline of this form of media.

Conversely, there are compelling reasons for humanity to venture into space.\nTo begin with, we can uncover numerous truths about our solar system. For example, an image of Earth confirmed its spherical shape, debunking the flat Earth theory. Another instance is that it is Earth that revolves around the sun, not the other way around. Without space exploration, these discoveries would remain unknown.\nSecondly, individuals can gain deeper insights into Earth itself. Observing Earth from space allows us to learn extensively about its atmosphere. With this understanding, initiatives can be developed to avert environmental threats like global warming.\nLastly, the development of advanced technology is greatly facilitated. As astronauts venture into the oxygen-less vacuum of space, scientific research into oxygen tanks becomes essential. Oxygen tanks have proven their utility not just in space but also in underwater applications. Furthermore, Spaceships, communication satellites, and space pens significantly benefit society.\nIn conclusion, I am of the opinion that humans ought to explore outer space. Although it demands substantial financial investment, space exploration has yielded the aforementioned advantages.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay039", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 417, "to": 480}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 497, "to": 550}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 565, "to": 645}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 672, "to": 738}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 740, "to": 805}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 817, "to": 871}], "label": "Claim", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 873, "to": 951}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 953, "to": 1057}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1067, "to": 1128}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1130, "to": 1245}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1247, "to": 1339}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1354, "to": 1436}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1478, "to": 1513}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 12}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 5, 8, 12]}

Many of us strive to keep up with the rapid progress of today's world. I firmly believe that even though adapting to the rapid pace might be a prudent strategy for aligning with today's world. Nevertheless, this approach may not be the most advantageous for our society.\nFirst and foremost, although the world operates at a fast pace, precision is still essential. Even straightforward tasks like homework demand precision. If we hurry through tasks, risking errors, we essentially make no effort, completing our studies only to meet deadlines superficially. In essence, this merely achieves the task itself, which holds little value. We should focus on enhancing our working capabilities rather than simply aiming to complete tasks. While it's true that keeping pace might require reviewing our work multiple times, consistent efforts will eventually enable us to increase our speed in completing tasks.\nIn addition, besides accuracy, efficiency is also crucial, demanding both quick completion and quality standards. Even if we manage to keep up by overlooking project details, focusing only on the general framework, it will not satisfy companies or clients. We will soon be sidelined, even if we maintain the pace because when issues arise, we'll have to revisit and correct our mistakes. This process could be even more costly and time-consuming than doing the work accurately from the outset.\nMoreover, when we examine this issue from a broader perspective, Some tasks cannot afford any errors, for example, in critical missions such as those by NASA, even a small mistake can have disastrous consequences. An error in calculating rocket trajectories could result in project failure, potentially costing trillions. In these situations, even if scientists wish to expedite tasks, they can't afford to overlook any mission aspects as it could cause significant issues.\nIn conclusion, even though we must keep pace with global advancements, we must exercise utmost caution because haphazard work is unacceptable if we wish to remain competitive.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay314", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 240, "to": 326}], "label": "Claim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 342, "to": 404}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 426, "to": 498}], "label": "Claim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 500, "to": 557}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 559, "to": 692}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 706, "to": 768}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 770, "to": 867}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 890, "to": 950}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 952, "to": 1038}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1053, "to": 1152}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1154, "to": 1295}], "label": "Claim", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1297, "to": 1352}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1361, "to": 1426}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1428, "to": 1532}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1599, "to": 1634}], "label": "Claim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1649, "to": 1746}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1748, "to": 1854}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1877, "to": 2006}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2035, "to": 2077}], "label": "Claim", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2079, "to": 2110}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2119, "to": 2182}], "label": "Claim", "id": 20}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 7, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 10, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 10, 14, 18, 19, 20]}
{"id": "id_87", "input": "In today's world, automobiles have become one of the most essential modes of transportation for daily life. The widespread ownership and usage of cars clearly illustrate their significance. Overall, I wholeheartedly support the viewpoint that cars have greatly enhanced modern living standards, due to various reasons.\nTo begin with, vehicles enable people to cover vast distances in a short period, bringing numerous benefits. Take, for instance, interpersonal relationships. Maintaining long-distance relationships has become easier for many individuals since frequent visits are made possible by owning a car. Reflecting on my own experiences, I remember that my car has been invaluable in allowing me to frequently meet my childhood friends despite living in a different city. I also managed to build a relationship with someone who lived 89 kilometers away. Thanks to my car, we were able to meet each weekend and still share a happy relationship today. Without my car, developing that relationship might not have been possible.\nMoreover, cars enhance employment opportunities as individuals can commute to work and take jobs farther from their homes. Additionally, this provides them with greater flexibility. For example, my father has traveled across Germany for work, which allowed him to earn a higher income. He used his car to drive to distant locations, worked there during the week, and returned home for the weekends. Without his car, he wouldn't have been able to balance his job and family life, making it an essential tool both financially and socially.\nLastly, cars facilitate frequent travel, enabling people to explore the world. Without personal vehicles, individuals are likely to remain in their hometowns or villages for most of their lives. They often rely on public transportation, which limits access to certain regions. There are still numerous locations worldwide that public transport doesn't reach and can only be accessed by car. Consequently, car owners have wider access to destinations and are more likely to experience diverse places.\nIn summary, the aforementioned points clearly outweigh the argument that cars are a major contributor to environmental pollution because they offer indispensable flexibility, which is vital in nearly every aspect of life. Flexibility in travel, social interactions, and career opportunities hinges heavily on personal mobility, and there's no tool more effective for this than owning a car.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay247", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 243, "to": 293}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 334, "to": 426}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 477, "to": 555}], "label": "Claim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 562, "to": 611}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 663, "to": 779}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 781, "to": 861}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 863, "to": 957}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 959, "to": 1032}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1044, "to": 1081}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1085, "to": 1155}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1171, "to": 1214}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1216, "to": 1318}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1320, "to": 1431}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1433, "to": 1570}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1580, "to": 1649}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1651, "to": 1765}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1767, "to": 1847}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1849, "to": 1961}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1977, "to": 2070}], "label": "Claim", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2145, "to": 2200}], "label": "Claim", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2209, "to": 2292}], "label": "Premise", "id": 20}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2294, "to": 2461}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 21}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 19, "target": 20, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 2, 8, 18, 19, 21]}

Some continue to depend on lectures to stay aligned with their coursework, whereas others feel that attending classes is unnecessary, thinking they can manage their exams independently. These varied perspectives on learning methods raise the question of whether university students need to attend classes if they can successfully pass their exams. Personally, I assert that students should consistently attend classes regardless of their exam results. \nFirstly, participating in class is more beneficial for learning than just studying alone to pass exams. Courses are meticulously crafted for students, and professors inherently possess more expertise than students. Professors bring not only knowledge but also valuable experience, guiding students toward academic success. \nSecondly, attending classes is a fundamental obligation for students. Being present in class is the most compelling way for students to demonstrate respect for both their professors and themselves. The attendance record is often a factor in how professors evaluate their students. Essentially, attendance is considered just as vital as performance in exams. Even those who excel in exams might fail if they don't attend classes.\nSome may contend that students might perceive they know the class materials sufficiently to pass exams or can learn the course independently. Why devote time to attending classes when studying independently might be more effective? Yet, in my view, this mindset is somewhat arrogant. I maintain that professors impart more knowledge than students can acquire on their own due to their experience and credentials. Additionally, even if students think they are exceptionally capable, they still benefit from attending classes to engage in discussions with professors and peers. \nIn conclusion, students gain deeper understanding and demonstrate respect for professors and themselves by attending classes.

{"id": "id_89", "input": "It is often claimed that competition serves as a catalyst for economic growth. To thrive amidst competition, companies consistently enhance their products and services, leading to societal prosperity. Yet, when we delve into the debate of competition versus cooperation, our focus shifts from society at large to the holistic development of an individual's life. From this perspective, I am convinced that greater emphasis should be placed on fostering cooperation during early education.\nTo begin with, cooperation allows children to develop interpersonal skills that are vital for their future. Teamwork teaches us not just how to achieve common objectives with others but more importantly, how to interact harmoniously with them. Through cooperation, children learn to listen to others' opinions, engage in effective communication, think broadly, and even find compromise in the face of disagreements. These skills facilitate harmonious relationships with others and provide lifelong benefits.\nConversely, competition's importance lies in the pursuit of excellence to achieve victory. This is why it is frequently noted that competition enhances societal efficiency. Nonetheless, when pondering how to secure victory, we invariably realize the necessity of cooperation. The loftier our objectives, the more crucial competition becomes. Consider the Olympics, a competitive arena; it is unimaginable for an athlete to succeed without the guidance of a coach and the support of a team managing diet and medical care. Although the athlete stands as the victor, the triumph is a collective achievement.

Personally, I am convinced that online courses should not replace traditional classroom education. Let me elaborate on my reasons.\nTo begin with, undeniably, classroom education is superior to online learning when it comes to delivering education. In a classroom setting, there's an opportunity to learn from fellow students, as observing classmates who exceed your performance can motivate you to improve. For instance, During my first year in B Com, I lacked dedication to my studies. However, observing friends achieving higher grades inspired me to enhance my academic performance. Ultimately, I achieved first place in the final exam.\nSecondly, classroom learning requires timely completion of assignments. This fosters excellent time management skills. Furthermore, participating in group studies teaches effective communication with others. It enhances communication and teamwork skills, which are beneficial for the future and one's career.\nThirdly, professors are crucial in classroom learning; many are experts in their fields and provide valuable insights and skills. Working under a professor, you can ask questions directly, which helps clarify doubts. Consequently, learning becomes more efficient. For example, I have my own experience. Initially, I relied on online courses for TOEFL IBT coaching, but after a month, I realized it was ineffective. Joining an institute, my English skills improved significantly in one month.\nIt cannot be denied that online courses offer certain benefits and can serve as a supplement, yet they cannot replace the traditional classroom learning experience. \nBased on the aforementioned points, it is evident that classroom learning is the most effective method for providing education for these reasons.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay297", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 206, "to": 271}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 332, "to": 420}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 422, "to": 498}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 503, "to": 579}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 595, "to": 758}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 772, "to": 812}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 824, "to": 884}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 886, "to": 931}], "label": "Claim", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 946, "to": 1020}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1022, "to": 1121}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1132, "to": 1251}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1253, "to": 1338}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1354, "to": 1385}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1426, "to": 1613}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1640, "to": 1707}], "label": "Claim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1713, "to": 1778}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1836, "to": 1925}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 16}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 15, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 1, 7, 12, 14, 16]}

The debate over whether children should commence learning a foreign language at the onset of their schooling is quite contentious. I believe students should embark on learning it as they begin school. Mastering it not only aids in boosting their mental faculties and memory but also broadens their perspectives regarding other nations. \nFirstly, the capacity for learning during childhood is stronger than at any other life stage. Consequently, students at the start of their education have the ability to grasp and assimilate a foreign language more swiftly and effortlessly compared to older learners. They can efficiently comprehend the linguistic framework and retain vocabulary. It is undeniable that the retention of knowledge acquired during childhood surpasses that of other life phases. By taking this into account and acknowledging that students don't have the same responsibilities and difficulties as older individuals, we can deduce why this period is optimal for language acquisition.\nFurthermore, Learning a foreign language greatly aids students in understanding global happenings.

{"id": "id_92", "input": "When we refer to a student, we typically think of a young person attending school or college. In certain countries, teenagers have the chance to take up part-time jobs alongside their studies. Yet, some individuals oppose the idea of teenagers working while studying. Personally, teenagers benefit from having a part-time job while still studying, and I have two main reasons for this.\nThe primary reason is that students gain valuable lessons from part-time work before embarking on their careers. They acquire skills in time management, financial handling, and effective communication. For instance, During high school, I worked for a year as a salesperson in a shop. Since I allocated part of my time to my job, thus, I learned to manage my time effectively. Balancing my responsibilities with my homework taught me to handle both efficiently. This experience taught me how to optimize my time and perform tasks swiftly and efficiently. Furthermore, I gained insights into financial management. When my manager was absent, I had to oversee the shop's accounts. This taught me how to handle money accurately. This experience showed that part-time jobs can impart numerous skills to students.\nAnother reason is that students can earn money from part-time jobs, which can alleviate their parents' financial burden. For example, during my high school years, I worked as a home tutor, teaching math to two neighborhood children. I assisted them in grasping challenging book topics. Through tutoring, I earned enough to purchase my own books. Additionally, After taking up that part-time job, I no longer needed pocket money from my parents. Clearly, Part-time work can enable students to earn, thus providing financial relief to their families.\nIn conclusion, I acknowledge that some people will likely disagree with the notion of students holding part-time jobs. They might contend that it might distract students from their academic pursuits. Nonetheless, since I worked part-time during high school without it affecting my academic performance, I am convinced that part-time employment is beneficial for students. Students should engage in part-time work alongside their studies if they wish to better prepare for their futures.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay298", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 280, "to": 346}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 413, "to": 497}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 499, "to": 586}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 602, "to": 668}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 670, "to": 713}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 721, "to": 760}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 762, "to": 845}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 847, "to": 938}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 953, "to": 996}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 998, "to": 1062}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1064, "to": 1109}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1111, "to": 1192}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1217, "to": 1313}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1480, "to": 1538}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1554, "to": 1637}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1648, "to": 1741}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1886, "to": 1941}], "label": "Claim", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1962, "to": 2044}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2066, "to": 2113}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 18}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 16, "target": 17, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 1, 12, 16, 18]}

This leads children to believe that academic diligence is unnecessary for securing a successful career and livelihood. Additionally, they may fail to appreciate the effort of others and assume everything is handed to them.\nMoreover, not every celebrity serves as an exemplary figure.

I firmly believe that animals ought to reside in their natural environments rather than being confined to zoos.\nFirstly, wild creatures have a fundamental right to exist in settings free from human interference. Considering that humans have caused significant pollution and destruction to the natural habitats of numerous wild creatures, Given the fact that humanity is to blame for the extensive pollution and severe harm inflicted on the natural habitats of many wild animals, we bear the responsibility of fostering a natural and secure habitat for these animals. Clearly, the cramped enclosures and imitation trees and lakes cannot adequately make up for what the animals have lost. Furthermore, prolonged captivity in zoos can adversely affect both the physical and mental health of these creatures. Consequently, wild animals might experience loneliness and depression. It appears that zoos are more likely to act as a threat rather than a safeguard to wildlife.\nOn the other hand, advocates suggest that zoos, furnished with cutting-edge facilities and skilled professionals, are believed to offer superior care to their inhabitants. They also highlight that endangered animals housed in zoos would be safe from illegal hunting. Yet, I maintain that stringent anti-poaching laws would offer protection to various animal species in their natural habitats.

A frequently discussed topic today is whether the government should bear responsibility for providing citizens with healthcare and education.\nSome individuals believe that the government is obligated to provide funding for citizens' healthcare and education. This is due to the fact that citizens are entitled to live in a peaceful and stable society, a responsibility that falls to the government as the societal leader. Without access to healthcare and education, citizens' physical health and mental well-being would be jeopardized. Consequently, such individuals might not receive timely medical treatment, affecting their work productivity and destabilizing industrial output. Additionally, without proper guidance from educators, these citizens might engage in misconduct or even criminal activities, endangering the safety of others. Hence, the government should be responsible for citizens' healthcare and education to ensure a secure and stable society.\nConversely, others argue against this viewpoint, suggesting that it's an inefficient use of public funds for the government to finance every citizen's healthcare and education, as many people are actually capable of paying for these services on their own. They propose instead that the government should focus on more urgent issues affecting people's well-being, such as the rising crime rate, the AIDS crisis, or infrastructure shortages, which demand government funding.\nIn my view, the government should provide financial support for healthcare and education to those who are economically disadvantaged, as they are the ones who genuinely need governmental assistance.

{"id": "id_98", "input": "It is widely acknowledged that under British and Australian legal systems, juries involved in a trial are not privy to the defendant's prior criminal activities. Some individuals express concern that this practice needs revision and that juries should at least be informed about the criminals to some extent before making their final decision. Personally, I fully endorse this suggestion as it offers benefits to various parties, which I will elaborate on below.\nFirst and foremost, I hold the opinion that it would simplify the decision-making process for juries if they were aware of the criminal's past. This is due to the fact that having a thorough understanding of the criminal's history allows juries to evaluate the crime before reaching a verdict. For example, consider a scenario where an individual with no prior record of murder is suddenly accused. By being informed of the individual's background, juries can assess whether the crime was committed intentionally or was influenced by circumstances. Subsequently, this enables punishment to be tailored to the specific situation.\nBeyond that, a fair trial can be ensured. As we are all aware, juries are typically composed of individuals with limited legal knowledge. Therefore, providing them with the defendant's past records allows for more rational deliberation and helps in forming a more coherent decision. By implementing this, juries will feel reassured that their conclusion is well-founded, based on substantial evidence. Furthermore, the defendant will also receive a just outcome.\nIt is indisputable that delving into and exposing the defendant's past to a group of unknown individuals compromises their privacy. If they are ultimately found not guilty, they might feel humiliated facing the public.

{"id": "id_99", "input": "Opinions vary significantly on whether possessing extensive knowledge across numerous academic disciplines is more advantageous than focusing on a single area. Some individuals argue that a wide-ranging understanding can enhance your odds of success, whereas others maintain that expertise in a particular field is essential for achieving success. Both sides present compelling arguments that seem reasonable. In my view, acquiring a wide range of knowledge is crucial for achieving success. I will elaborate on my reasoning below.\nTo begin with, understanding various fields can facilitate building friendships more easily. For instance, I was employed at a large organization with multiple departments. I worked in the Management Information Systems department, where our daily task was addressing client inquiries over the phone. Even when some issues were the responsibility of the Engineering department, I visited and collaborated with colleagues there, as I had taken several engineering courses. This made communication smoother for me compared to others in my department, boosting my popularity and making it easier to receive assistance.\nFurthermore, having knowledge in diverse areas is crucial when transitioning your major. Consider my cousin Jeff and his friend. They studied finance in college but opted to pursue a career in the arts after graduation. Jeff's diligent efforts during his spare time allowed him to gain extensive knowledge of art history. As a result, he became part of a prestigious team, whereas his friend, who was limited to finance knowledge, ended up working at a bank.\nWhile I acknowledge the significance of understanding various fields, I must highlight that there are differing perspectives. Critics may assert that if someone cannot succeed in their own major, it's questionable what they can achieve in a different field. This perspective may hold some truth. Nevertheless, what if they eventually discover a talent in another area. In this context, the issue becomes negligible.\nIn conclusion, after weighing the pros and cons of having diverse field knowledge, the optimal choice clearly aligns with my stance, which is that having an extensive understanding of various subjects is truly essential.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay263", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 422, "to": 490}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 547, "to": 623}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 833, "to": 958}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 963, "to": 1002}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1004, "to": 1146}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1161, "to": 1235}], "label": "Claim", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1368, "to": 1468}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1470, "to": 1605}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1757, "to": 1863}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1917, "to": 1974}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2170, "to": 2242}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 10}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 1, 5, 8, 10]}

The previous century has unveiled the terrifying consequences of such weapons. If every nation engages in nuclear fusion and fission, some might attempt to adapt it for military purposes.\nAnother argument supporting my viewpoint is that even the peaceful use of nuclear energy carries a significant risk of radioactive contamination. For instance, there was a recent incident where an atomic power plant released tons of radioactive material into the air following an earthquake in the vicinity. This unfortunate occurrence demonstrates that no matter how cautious we are, such accidents are unavoidable.\nFinally, whether generating energy from hydropower or oil, there is always some waste, and nuclear energy is no exception. disposing of nuclear waste safely is a challenging endeavor, with no permanent solution yet discovered. This waste is significantly more harmful to the environment than any other hazardous materials.\nIn conclusion, from the aforementioned points, it is clear that nuclear energy might seem like a quick fix for the energy crisis, but its negative aspects greatly overshadow the positives.

Teachers are the ones who assist them in overcoming educational challenges. Conversely, students absorb most of their knowledge through teachers and rely on them to discern right from wrong.\nThose who believe that students gain a greater understanding from alternative sources like the Internet and TV, strongly assert that through these sources, students access a wealth of information unavailable in traditional classes.

Furthermore, they argue that quality television programs can indeed educate students. For example, Programs like the Discovery Channel offer numerous educational episodes. Students gain insights into different cultures, outer space, and more.\nIn my opinion, I believe that students acquire significantly more knowledge from their teachers than from any other source.

Personally, online education should be extensively implemented in colleges and universities due to its convenience and cost-effectiveness for educational bodies.\nFirst and foremost, distance learning offers tremendous convenience to students across the globe. In the past, students faced with the burden of commuting had no choice but to attend nearby schools, regardless of disparities in educational facilities, teacher qualifications, or the institution's reputation. Nowadays, however, students have the option to enroll in online courses from prestigious universities and colleges around the world. Additionally, video conferencing technology enables a teacher to instruct a larger group of students. As a result, educational institutions can cut costs by increasing the teacher-to-student ratio. With the cost-effective nature of online teaching, universities and colleges can provide scholarships to academically gifted students who are financially unable to attend in-person classes.\nOn the other hand, critics of online degrees assert that attending lectures face-to-face offers students a chance to interact with instructors and peers.

By being employed, a wife can generate extra funds to enhance her family's living standards. This is particularly essential in situations where the husband's salary is insufficient, and securing a well-paying job is challenging in the current market. Therefore, it is commonplace for women to contribute financially as partners in the household.\nMoreover, working outside the home provides married women with opportunities to engage with the world, build their character, and demonstrate their abilities.

As a result, there is no doubt they fulfill their roles as mothers and wives more effectively.\nLastly, in the current era, there are numerous supportive measures that assist women in managing both household duties and career responsibilities. In addition to government policies promoting smaller families and the involvement of husbands in domestic chores, many employers are open to offering part-time positions to women.\nTo sum up, a well-managed household does not require the constant presence of the housewife throughout the day and married women should have the option to work and enjoy the experiences of the professional world outside the home.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay029", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 15, "to": 163}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 165, "to": 272}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 341, "to": 413}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 415, "to": 506}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 508, "to": 664}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 677, "to": 759}], "label": "Claim", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 771, "to": 918}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 920, "to": 989}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 991, "to": 1056}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1071, "to": 1151}], "label": "Claim", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1181, "to": 1299}], "label": "Claim", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1301, "to": 1479}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1492, "to": 1591}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1596, "to": 1709}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 13}], "edges": [{"source": 5, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 5, 9, 10, 12, 13]}

Consequently, some people propose that tax revenue should primarily support public services rather than the arts. Nevertheless, in my opinion, I believe that the arts should also be part of the government's investment strategy.\nCertainly, priority should be given by the government to public services and infrastructure. This is because as a guiding force among citizens, the government has the duty to ensure that tax money is utilized effectively to maintain societal safety and stability.

Thus, adequate focus on public services and facilities by the authorities is essential for preserving social stability.\nConversely, I am convinced that under no circumstances should the government overlook the arts. On a personal level, the arts have the ability to enhance cultural life. With the current climate of intense work and academic competition, individuals are more occupied than ever. As a result, they need different forms of entertainment, such as music, films, or books, to relax and alleviate stress. in the absence of arts, there would be a greater risk of psychological issues among people.\nFrom a local community perspective, investing in the arts can enhance both local cultural and economic growth.

Some people worry that this might result in a drop in education quality and suggest that professors should devote more time to teaching. However, based on my experiences, professors should be encouraged to focus primarily on research.\nFirstly, conducting research acts as a means for professors' self-enhancement. Universities are relatively isolated environments. Engaging in research projects facilitates communication with the external world. Additionally, through research, professors can stay abreast of the latest advancements in modern technologies. I vividly recall that my professor was involved in multiple research projects during my college years. He frequently received invitations to give lectures at other universities. Even though even though my university is not highly ranked, he earned recognition through those projects. Research projects serve as gateways to a broader world.\nSecondly, professors should make full use of the research-friendly atmosphere offered by universities. It's quite common to find cutting-edge laboratories on campus. Furthermore, there is no other place where you can find such a concentration of talented individuals. As a result, there's no valid reason to discourage professors from taking advantage of these resources. Everyone knows that Einstein formulated the theory of general relativity while he was a professor at HU Berlin. Universities play a supportive role in the achievements of professors.\nLastly, Research activities can also enhance the quality of teaching. Research projects enable professors to guide students from the classroom into the real world. They are able to teach students how to apply theoretical knowledge in practical situations. I still remember the experience of assisting in one of my professor's research projects. Participating in it gave me the chance to apply textbook theories in actual experiments.

{"id": "id_113", "input": "In today's educational landscape, children are presented with various competitive opportunities in both academics and athletics, which can ignite their desire to learn and excel, as well as impart crucial teamwork skills. Nonetheless, there are differing opinions on whether fostering competitiveness or cooperation in children is more beneficial, both of which have their own merits.\nA strong competitive spirit encourages children to strive for excellence and to be the best among their peers, a drive that is largely cultivated by schools and parents through the grading system.. Although children who are competitive tend to be more driven to achieve goals or confront challenges independently, there's a downside that there is a danger that excessive competitiveness might hinder children's ability to collaborate with others. While being competitive can lead to achievements, it may also limit them in various aspects. For instance, a highly competitive individual might struggle to effectively participate in team-based projects.\nConversely, cooperation is an equally vital trait for children, whether in school activities or within the community. A cooperative attitude enhances children's ability to interact and collaborate with others, enabling them to solve problems and accomplish goals more efficiently as a team. Ultimately, in the real world, significant achievements are rarely accomplished by an individual alone. For example, successful singers or movie stars, regardless of their innate talent, rely on a team to handle various aspects of their career.\nFrom my perspective, while a competitive child is likely to have increased motivation and a broader perspective that can lead them to success, it's important to consider that this trait might not be as advantageous when they transition into environments that demand teamwork skills, such as society or the workplace.

{"id": "id_114", "input": "Having had the opportunity to study alongside my classmates, I often wish I could travel back in time and retake all my exams. I have a strong preference for group study because of its distinct advantages, such as receiving assistance from peers, enhancing my learning mindset, and efficiently managing my time.\nWhen students form study groups, every member has an equal opportunity to assist one another. Collaboratively, they can tackle the challenging aspects of a course. For instance, if a group encounters a difficult math problem, they can exchange ideas to solve it. Additionally, the collaborative nature of group study significantly helps all students strengthen their weaknesses. \nEnhancing motivation and fostering a spirit of competition are additional advantages of studying in groups. Within a group of students, the top performers often inspire others to increase their efforts. Moreover, students frequently engage in healthy competition to achieve the highest grades in the group. Clearly, improved learning outcomes are a standout result of this competition and encouragement. \nWhen students study with friends, they need a schedule to utilize their time effectively. Studying in a group creates a sense of responsibility to manage time well, as we are considerate of others and aim not to waste their time. Thus, efficient time management is another significant advantage of group study. \nTo conclude, I am a firm believer in the benefits of studying with friends due to the valuable opportunities it presents.

Regrettably, the majority of people fail to establish a plan or schedule to limit their television viewing.

The appearance of new television channels or shows is not unexpected. We spend our time following these channels, only to realize at the day's end that it's too late for other activities. This is an issue that plagues us all daily. Ultimately, there is little time left to call our parents or friends.\nFurthermore, I believe watching television shows induces laziness in us. We typically spend at least three hours a day in front of the TV after a full day of work at the office. Therefore, we lack the time for healthy activities like going to the gym or participating in sports. This turns us into lazy individuals who prefer passive activities like watching TV rather than being active and social.\nLastly, but certainly not least, certain television programs negatively impact viewers.

There's a saying in my hometown, \"Health is Wealth,\" which highlights a truth that many, including myself, tend to overlook\u2014the significance of maintaining good health. The demand for longer working hours might stem from a highly competitive environment and the desire to earn more money and promotions. Nevertheless, individuals who engage in prolonged work hours often experience negative impacts on their health and personal lives. In my view, it is essential to establish a balance between personal and professional life by limiting the maximum number of working hours. \nTo begin with, many would concur that those who choose to work extra hours often lack the time to prioritize their health. By working excessively, they frequently become exhausted, inactive, and unwilling to engage in physical activities to stay fit, ultimately compromising their health and falling ill. Furthermore, they become deeply absorbed in their work, turning into workaholics. The consequences are so dire that their families and friends are deprived of their attention, leading to a loss of balance between their family and personal lives.\nAdditionally, these workaholics often do not allocate time to contribute to society by engaging in social initiatives. Since they are typically occupied with their office responsibilities, they lack the free time to participate in such social activities. For example, Take my boss as an example; he has been working extended hours in the office for many years. Recently, his health and personal life suffered significantly as he went through a divorce, and his family life is in complete disarray. He now regrets his choices and is attempting to manage his work better, but it appears to be too late for him.\nIn conclusion, I strongly advocate and suggest that the government should mandate a maximum number of working hours in its Labor Law and enforce it across all companies to ensure employees don't spend excessive hours at work.

Despite the debate, I firmly believe pets ought to be considered akin to human beings for various reasons.\nTo begin with, pets are companions just as some humans are. Much like friends, they are constantly by our side and provide company during times of solitude. We can communicate with them because they offer a listening ear, often more than some people ever will. Allow me to share a personal story to clarify this point. At the age of 14, I lost my uncle, leaving me feeling as though nothing else mattered. Discussing with my friends was disheartening because none of them had ever experienced such emotions. Given that I spent quite some time alone at home, my dog stayed by my side, and it felt as though he was the only one who truly grasped my profound emotions. It's apparent that even though pets cannot verbally communicate with us, we can still rely on them.\nFurthermore, pets serve a multitude of purposes. For instance, pet therapy is gaining popularity in recent times. Studies have shown that pets can provide significant benefits for numerous ailments.

Furthermore, It is a source of national pride, reflecting a wealth of culture that fosters patriotism.\nConversely, There are certain disadvantages associated with preserving minority languages. Despite the fact that Even if governments invest in this initiative, achieving positive outcomes is challenging. For instance, A minority, especially among the youth, shows little interest in learning and preserving these languages. Such languages are often complex and not widely spoken. Additionally, Preservation efforts require extensive time to compile, restore information, and provide training in educational institutions.

While many individuals have embraced this fast-paced lifestyle, others have opted to slow down and savor their time. To fully understand the implications, it\u2019s essential to weigh both the benefits and drawbacks of this increased speed of life and reflect on which lifestyle might be preferable. Personally, it is crucial to embrace a slower pace of life, as rushing through life has numerous downsides.\nTo begin with, leading a fast-paced life induces significant stress and can harm your health. Constantly rushing without taking breaks can lead to physical and mental strain. Furthermore, A considerable number of hardworking individuals suffer from conditions like burnout, as their bodies are unable to sustain such a relentless pace. For example, my father experienced a breakdown a few years ago due to the overwhelming demands of his job. After taking a few weeks off, he recovered, adopted a slower lifestyle, and has been in good health since.\nMoreover, slowing down in life contributes significantly to personal happiness. Excessive stress prevents you from dedicating time and attention to your loved ones. By avoiding a rushed lifestyle, you can spend more quality time with family and friends. Nurturing your social relationships not only enhances happiness but also reduces stress. For instance, a close friend of mine leads a relaxed life and is extremely content with it, as he enjoys his family life and maintains strong friendships.\nLastly, achieving quality outcomes requires sufficient time. When tasks are rushed, they are more prone to preventable errors. Rushing through tasks may result in overlooking critical details or opportunities. Consequently, mistakes that could have been avoided with more patience are likely to occur.

For instance, in Cambodia, the influx of tourists visiting the Angkor Wat temple necessitates services like dining establishments, accommodations, souvenir shops, and other retail outlets. These needs stimulate associated businesses in the vicinity, leading to job creation for locals, improved infrastructure, and a better standard of living. Consequently, tourism has undoubtedly enhanced the quality of life in the host country.\nFurthermore, through the tourism sector, numerous cultural traditions have been safeguarded, and natural habitats have been conserved.

Nevertheless, it is clear that ready-to-eat meals can have adverse effects due to the use of artificial ingredients, neglect of nutritional value, and alteration of dietary habits. In this essay, I aim to elucidate why this trend is problematic, drawing on the aforementioned three reasons.\nTo begin with, to make food more convenient and palatable, almost all manufacturers add various artificial ingredients to the products frequently purchased today. Several the added ingredients have led to serious repercussions. For example, there are often newspaper and magazine articles that highlight the link between specific chemical components in certain foods and illnesses. Consequently, convenience foods can occasionally pose health risks.\nNeglecting to cook fresh meals can also result in nutritional deficiencies. It's undeniable that preparing ready meals is significantly quicker than cooking with fresh ingredients. However, some studies have clearly shown that prepackaged meals fail to provide the necessary nutrients, particularly for growing children.\nMoreover, cooking is an art form crafted by humans. The more we consume prepackaged meals, the more we lose our culinary skills. With the fast-paced lifestyle, most people rely on microwaves as their sole cooking appliance, allowing them to prepare meals in mere minutes. However, few people realize that this shift has altered cooking habits, potentially leading to the erosion of our culinary traditions and culture.\nIn summary, even though the introduction of ready meals undoubtedly meets the needs of those who are tied up with work, it is not beneficial.

{"id": "id_127", "input": "Regarding the debate on whether classmates or colleagues should collaborate on projects face-to-face or through email, I firmly believe that in-person collaboration is more favorable as it facilitates effective communication. \nTo begin with, team members often have varying perspectives and need to efficiently reach a consensus. Clearly, face-to-face discussions in meetings are significantly more effective than email exchanges. In a study by Beijing University, two groups were asked to discuss the budget for an event. The first group had an in-person conversation, while the second communicated via email. The findings indicate that the first group reached a budget agreement in 30 minutes, whereas it took the second group 30 hours. Similar experiments by other researchers yielded the same outcome, showing quicker agreements when people converse directly. \nMoreover, in-person collaboration can enhance both the quality and efficiency of the project because there will be fewer disputes or disagreements among team members. Sending an email for a casual issue can make it seem more formal, thus recipients might feel anxious or potentially offended by the written words. Although if the same words are spoken, the other party tends to be more at ease since their responses won't be documented, reducing the chance of misinterpreting informal talks as formal statements. Hence, fewer misunderstandings result in fewer conflicts and improved communication among team members. \nIt must be acknowledged that there are occasions when emails are necessary if team members are geographically dispersed. While emails, while not the most convenient, are better than having no communication. Given that for classroom or campus projects, it's unlikely that members are in different locations. \nAdditionally, it's important to note that projects require substantial coordination, and relying solely on email can lead to overwhelming volumes of messages, which is not ideal.

The reality is that harmful bacteria and germs in polluted water can enter people's bodies indirectly, leading to serious health complications that might be fatal if not promptly addressed. \nFurthermore, it is probable that many consumables in large cities are unsafe for consumption. Recent studies indicate that toxic food products are widely available in today's markets. In addition, overcrowding can contribute to the spread of infectious diseases, such as colds, sneezing, and other illnesses. Moreover, residing in such urban areas also means being in regions with high crime rates. Unemployed individuals or those who have left school are more prone to engage in criminal activities ranging from minor offenses to serious crimes like burglary, pickpocketing, fraud, vandalism, smuggling, or even homicide. Finding ways to earn a living becomes increasingly challenging, and maintaining good health in these areas is also becoming more difficult.\nIn summary, I am convinced that urban living can adversely affect individuals' health. Therefore, both authorities and citizens should take measures to mitigate the associated impacts.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay387", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 125, "to": 171}], "label": "Claim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 195, "to": 251}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 253, "to": 346}], "label": "Claim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 348, "to": 462}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 478, "to": 522}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 544, "to": 712}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 728, "to": 807}], "label": "Claim", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 809, "to": 897}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 912, "to": 1022}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1034, "to": 1112}], "label": "Claim", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1114, "to": 1336}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1338, "to": 1476}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1510, "to": 1563}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 12}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 6, 9, 11, 12]}
{"id": "id_129", "input": "Today's society is characterized by intense competition. Some argue that it's crucial to instill a collaborative mindset in children, while others believe that competition is the key to success. Nonetheless, fostering cooperation aids a child in growing into a responsible adult with strong moral principles and a supportive social network. Collaboration is vital for effective teamwork. Educational institutions place importance on promoting a collaborative mindset among children. Given our social environment, mutual assistance and sharing ultimately lead to success. An individual cannot learn or accomplish everything independently. For example, lions hunt collectively. Their teamwork is the reason they can catch prey and simplify the task. Similarly, a cooperative approach conserves time and energy and increases the likelihood of success. Yet, collaboration enables us to understand different viewpoints and learn from others' mistakes. It allows individuals to recognize their strengths and weaknesses in comparison to others. A collaborative mindset can inspire and motivate by observing others' successes. However, competition holds equal significance to collaboration. Sadly, the essence of competition has been misinterpreted in a negative way. One should focus on self-competition rather than aiming to surpass others. Competition has driven advancements in science and technology. Competition fosters development and progress. For instance, companies continuously develop new cars that outperform others in efficiency. Such competition provides consumers with a wider range of choices. Nonetheless, reckless and selfish competition is harmful. The mentality of 'your loss, my gain' is unsustainable in the long term. Competition should always be rooted in the principle of self-betterment. The most effective approach is a healthy competition that focuses on personal advancement over others. Therefore, competition and cooperation are interconnected. They represent two aspects of the same reality that cannot be separated.

Unlike humans, machines don't require breaks, meaning they can operate for extended periods, consistently delivering high-quality products without errors. Additionally, employing machines can reduce company expenses. Since machines don't demand salaries, overtime pay, or pensions, thus employers are not obligated to allocate funds for employee benefits. The company only requires a few technicians to ensure machines operate correctly and to replace parts when necessary. \nNevertheless, the drawbacks machines introduce should not be ignored. To begin with, due to the widespread use of machines, numerous individuals have lost their jobs. In nations with large populations, high unemployment rates can lead to crime and social unrest. Beyond this, machines also contribute to significant pollution and energy wastage. For instance, nowadays, people prefer using dishwashers over hand washing dishes.

Specifically, complex and abstract knowledge, which these students grasp easily, may become burdensome for those lacking similar abilities. Furthermore, it is undeniable that individuals earn rewards based on their efforts. University serves as a reward for those who have strived diligently to achieve it.\nOn the other hand, the university experience encompasses not only academic learning but also the cultivation of artistic talents and the development of soft skills. Thus, it should be accessible to the majority of young individuals, allowing them to follow their passions and grow holistically. \nAdditionally, limiting university access to only top students could potentially lead to an increase in societal issues. Besides those who feel discouraged, many lack the necessary preparation, becoming prone to failure when seeking employment, especially in white-collar jobs.\nIn summary, restricting university access has its advantages and disadvantages.

Thanks to cutting-edge technology, developed countries have made significant advancements in creating medications that can treat various critical illnesses. If people in less affluent nations have access to these medications, their health conditions could improve. Reducing the cost of medicines reflects an act of compassion.\nHowever, the current pricing of medicines is actually fair and reflects their effectiveness. Clearly, the investment in research, testing, and mass production of drugs demands a significant financial commitment. Furthermore, these products are essential in safeguarding human health. If companies were compelled to lower drug prices, they would struggle to make profits, potentially incurring losses due to production costs. Thus, such a measure cannot be implemented, or else these companies might face bankruptcy. Ultimately, this approach is not sustainable.\nFortunately, there are alternative strategies to improve the situation. Governments are urged to promote pharmaceutical manufacturing by providing land for factory construction and offering tax reductions.

Some propose that the government should minimize restrictions on the dissemination of media information to the public. Nonetheless, I am firmly convinced that increased regulation is necessary to shield the public from inappropriate content and foreign influences that may not align with local values.\nA compelling reason for stricter media regulation is to restrict exposure to violent and sexual content. Such content significantly affects individuals going through adolescence. For instance, a cartoon comedy on the internet, called Happy Tree, is notably violent, often showing characters with severed heads or limbs. Another argument supporting this is that television networks frequently import foreign shows, potentially leading audiences to adopt ideas that clash with local cultural norms. There was a Japanese game show some years back that involved throwing cream pies at the loser. This practice is actually quite harmful to the environment.\nA significant counterargument revolves around ensuring citizen safety. Specifically, it is crucial for the government to release information to the media promptly, particularly regarding disasters and emerging diseases. For example, during the SARS outbreak in 2003, the Chinese government's restriction on public information access resulted in numerous fatalities. Nevertheless, another view is that it helps to mitigate unnecessary public panic and disorder.\nBoth sides present valid points.

A prime example supporting this notion is the creation of smartphones. The robust navigation systems in these devices have saved the lives of many who found themselves stranded in remote locations such as forests or deserts.

In light of this, some argue that we shouldn't expect politeness from others. However, I strongly disagree with this perspective, and I will outline my reasons below.\nFirstly, a person with good manners leaves a positive impression on others. Such impressions make it easier for an individual to form connections and integrate quickly into the community around them. For instance, When I started at a new company, if I displayed good manners and treated everyone kindly, my new colleagues would accept me, and even my employers would recognize me. Conversely, if I were rude, I wouldn't be able to get along well with others. Ultimately, This could lead to me being fired and having no option but to lose my job.\nSecondly, politeness earns mutual respect. Kind words and courteous behavior not only help the speaker gain a good reputation but also uplift listeners who are in need. A thriving organization is built on mutual respect and enjoyable interactions. Numerous examples have shown that polite individuals tend to achieve success more easily, because through their conduct, they allow their peers or adversaries to recognize their own self-worth.\nLastly, society requires a cultured environment and orderliness. Furthermore, The level of civilization in a society is linked to the quality of its people. To create a better living space for ourselves and future generations, we must emphasize politeness and good manners in our actions.

Personally, I believe that prioritizing international aid is essential.\nGlobal aid holds immense importance as individuals in other nations might be grappling with far graver challenges. Take many African nations for instance, where countless people live below basic living standards. They are deprived of essential needs like food, water, or clothing, let alone educational opportunities. Furthermore, those residing in war-torn or disaster-stricken areas face even more dire issues like insecurity, homelessness, or the loss of loved ones. Clearly, these individuals are in urgent need of international aid.\nWhile aiding those outside our borders is crucial, there is a valid argument for assisting our compatriots.

{"id": "id_145", "input": "Over the past ten years, the workload for university students has steadily grown. Some argue that students shouldn't attend classes until they pass their exams. Others believe students can enroll in university courses without exam success. However, in my view, students can gain university knowledge without having to pass exams first. The reasons are outlined below.\nFirstly, students aren't always proficient in every aspect of a subject. For instance, I love Physics, yet I'm not fond of electronics, because electronics aren't frequently encountered in everyday life. And my physics score was zero when studying electronics. But I consistently scored 100 in other areas of physics. If I had to pass the electronics exam before attending classes, I'd repeatedly fail the entire physics course. Fortunately, at our university, class attendance isn't dependent on exam scores. And I'm able to study physics without worrying about electronics. Eventually, I revisited electronics and passed the exam.\nSecondly, if universities enforce a policy requiring exam passage before class attendance, students may remain unengaged. Failing most exams means missing out on most classes. And students might find themselves idle on campus. Then They could end up playing online games day and night. This would lead to declining academic performance. Ultimately, Such students might face failure in life. All because universities don't allow them to attend classes. This reflects not just a university's failure but also that of the entire educational system.\nCertainly, university students might not excel if they're allowed to attend classes regardless of exam results. However, the benefits of unrestricted class access outweigh concerns about lower scores.\nIn conclusion, universities should permit students to attend classes without passing exams because not only are students not masters of every aspect of a subject, but it also prevents them from remaining unengaged on campus.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay311", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 261, "to": 334}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 377, "to": 439}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 475, "to": 502}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 512, "to": 570}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 572, "to": 627}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 629, "to": 684}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 686, "to": 795}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 797, "to": 876}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 878, "to": 942}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 944, "to": 999}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1011, "to": 1121}], "label": "Claim", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1123, "to": 1175}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1177, "to": 1226}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1233, "to": 1285}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1287, "to": 1336}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1350, "to": 1390}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1392, "to": 1451}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1453, "to": 1545}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1558, "to": 1657}], "label": "Claim", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1668, "to": 1746}], "label": "Premise", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1763, "to": 1838}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 20}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1847, "to": 1971}], "label": "Claim", "id": 21}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 19, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 1, 10, 18, 20, 21]}

Despite the impact of criminals on society, particularly on victims, is undoubtedly severe, they remain human, and their existence should be cherished. Furthermore, capital punishment fails to address the aftermath of criminal acts, coupled with the fact that it may cause suffering to the offender's relatives, while the pain felt by the victim's family remains unassuaged.\nSecondly, the death penalty is not the exclusive method to curb crime rates; life imprisonment effectively confines offenders for their lifetime. Additionally, when it comes to punishment, enduring a desolate life with restricted access to the outside world and facing daily guilt in a confined space is far more tormenting than instant execution.\nAnother reason to abolish the death penalty is the risk of wrongful convictions. Jurors are human too; they can sometimes lack judgment. Consequently, numerous individuals face execution for crimes they did not perpetrate, raising concerns about the justice system's fairness.\nIn summary, while capital punishment serves as a severe cautionary measure to the populace, I strongly oppose it since it is irrational and lacks humanity.

{"id": "id_147", "input": "The tourism industry is emerging as a potent driver of economic progress. However, some individuals argue that this viewpoint overlooks the environmental and ecological harm caused by tourism activities, which negatively impact local communities and ecosystems. While both perspectives appear valid, I believe that with proper oversight and regulation, a thriving tourism sector can be a fantastic source of economic advancement and prosperity for both rural and urban regions.\nOne of the most evident benefits is that tourism can significantly propel economic growth in a specific state or area. This occurs not only through tourists' direct spending but also by creating direct and indirect employment opportunities for the community, such as in retail, agriculture, and the service sector. A robust and well-regulated tourism program also leads to increased taxes and the expansion of local markets for accommodation, luxury products, and more. Moreover, tourism generates a significant amount of direct and indirect jobs in the community, including positions in retail, hospitality, transportation, agriculture, and services. The rise in employment opportunities enables more individuals to contribute meaningfully to society by purchasing goods with their increased earnings. Consequently, this invigorates the economic cycle, thereby fostering local economic prosperity.\nSome might argue against these points, highlighting the environmental and cultural damage tourism can cause. Indeed, in comparison to tourism, other alternatives like resource extraction and manufacturing are far greater destroyers. For example, paper mills release hundreds of thousands of tons of pollutants into rivers, leading to severe water contamination. Conversely, the vast majority of tourists, especially those who invest considerable time and money in exploring rural villages, tend to be well-educated. It is unreasonable to assume that these sensible individuals will not behave responsibly if required to do so.\nAfter thoroughly weighing both sides of the debate, the tourism industry is appealing due to its significant socioeconomic benefits.

I believe that it is imperative that we alter our perspective on environmental matters due to various reasons.\nTo begin with, biodiversity holds significant importance for future generations. Failing to adapt our actions will lead to the extinction of numerous species that have inhabited the planet for millions of years. As we obliterate natural habitats, such as forests, jungles, and lakes, to accommodate our industries and farming, we disrupt the ecosystem. For instance, a substantial portion of the South American rainforest is cleared daily for timber and agricultural purposes. Neglecting to protect this vital segment of our ecosystem will result in numerous endangered species losing their natural habitats and facing extinction. Therefore, future generations will miss the chance to observe and study these creatures.\nMoreover, a balanced and sustainable environment is crucial for maintaining weather patterns. Our actions lead to pollution, which significantly impacts weather conditions on Earth and contributes to undeniable global warming. This not only harms endangered species, but also humans since we are challenged by rising sea levels and shifting climate patterns.

{"id": "id_150", "input": "Digital media has gained immense popularity among individuals worldwide. With this evolution, newspapers and magazines are finding it challenging to justify their existence. Some argue that traditional print media will soon become obsolete due to the rise of internet-based media. However, many still believe they will endure. I concur with the notion that newspapers and magazines will gradually become relics of the past. I will justify my perspective by examining how the internet delivers updates on current events swiftly and provides easy access to historical news.\nA crucial role of media is to disseminate information on current events as rapidly as possible, particularly during crises. This allows readers to stay informed and respond appropriately. For instance, when the aircraft MH 370 disappeared, everyone was eager to learn the details of this tragic event. The relatives and friends of passengers and crew were desperate for answers. In such scenarios, newspapers and magazines cannot match the speed of digital media. Instead of waiting for the next print edition, people can obtain reliable information about ongoing events from the internet in just a couple of hours. This illustrates why digital media will dominate over print newspapers and magazines.\nPeople frequently seek access to historical news for purposes like research or personal interest. For example, a researcher might wish to understand how a small Japanese village named Oramaki was affected after World War II. Acquiring such historical information from newspapers and magazines is challenging, as one must know where to search.

Additionally, constant mobile phone use can harm children's eyesight and physical posture.\nMoreover, numerous games available on phones are highly aggressive, such as \"Iron Man\". in these games, children are rewarded for increased violence, which they repeat frequently.

Consequently, communication difficulties may arise.\nOn the other hand, some individuals might view this issue differently. thanks to the rapid advancement of the internet, people can now enjoy swift electronic communication. For instance, with numerous chat apps available online, such as \"WeChat,\" people tend to send free instant messages using their phones rather than engage in face-to-face conversations.

While this practice can have some negative consequences, I am convinced that the positives far surpass the downsides.

Part-time employment provides them with invaluable opportunities to apply what they are learning in their academic courses. Furthermore, which becomes increasingly crucial given the current lack of adequate practical resources offered by universities. Consequently, students who work part-time gain not only theoretical knowledge but also practical experience. Additionally, acquiring work experience while still a student gives them a considerable edge when seeking employment post-graduation.\nSecondly, students who undertake part-time work often exhibit more self-assurance and independence compared to their peers. Through regular interaction with colleagues in a professional setting where new ideas can be freely shared, students significantly boost their self-confidence. Moreover, the demands of the workplace require students to think independently, work autonomously, and solve problems, skills that prove invaluable when applied to their university subjects.\nLastly, taking on extra jobs assists students in covering their living expenses. Truly, The burden of high tuition fees, coupled with increasing accommodation costs, is becoming overwhelming for students. The earnings from extra work, although typically modest, can help mitigate these financial challenges to some extent. Furthermore, this financial independence reduces students' reliance on their families and prepares them for self-sufficiency in the future.\nTo sum up, I am confident that holding a part-time job during university offers students numerous tangible advantages.

To begin with, when examining the facts, women have demonstrated their capabilities in all areas, whether indoors or outdoors. For instance, today's women are employed both at home and in aviation. They excel as homemakers and are also successfully piloting aircraft. Additionally, university admissions should not be influenced by gender bias. The primary criterion for admission should be the student's academic performance. \nNevertheless, the present job market influences university decisions. Each university tailors its curriculum to meet the demands of employers. Job selection criteria are established in advance. For example employers seek male candidates for demanding tasks like machinery repair and installation. They favor male employees for overnight shifts. They prefer female candidates for roles requiring a gentle demeanor such as counseling, teaching, and design. Consequently, universities cater to job market demands by selecting subjects deemed appropriate for specific genders.\nIn summary, I firmly assert that universities should allow individuals to freely choose their subjects. Today's youth exhibit strong confidence in shaping their careers. They refuse to be confined by imposed limitations. Female candidates disregard societal and employer-imposed restrictions. Therefore, we must provide them with the chance to pursue their aspirations.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay018", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 435, "to": 506}], "label": "Claim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 549, "to": 633}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 649, "to": 704}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 706, "to": 774}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 790, "to": 851}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 853, "to": 933}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 950, "to": 1004}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1006, "to": 1077}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1079, "to": 1128}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1142, "to": 1231}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1233, "to": 1279}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1281, "to": 1389}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1405, "to": 1507}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1542, "to": 1611}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1613, "to": 1677}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1679, "to": 1728}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1730, "to": 1800}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1813, "to": 1877}], "label": "Claim", "id": 17}], "edges": [{"source": 0, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 0, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 17, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 17, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 17, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 12, 13, 17]}
{"id": "id_159", "input": "University students have varied perspectives regarding their class attendance. Some argue that attending classes should be mandatory, while others feel it should be a matter of choice. In my view, since university-level education implies students possess the maturity to make their own choices, I firmly believe that students should have the option to attend classes as they wish.\nFirstly, attending classes can sometimes be a waste of time. For example, certain lecturers at our university merely recite the texts available in the reference books for their courses. Additionally, they fail to clarify the content in a manner comprehensible to students. This resulted in a waste of time. Given that university students are mature individuals, they are capable of reading and understanding textbooks on their own. Furthermore, with the advent of modern technology, students can gather information from various sources. For instance, students can access numerous articles and e-books online and watch video tutorials that present information more clearly. On the other hand, some lecturers present lectures in a highly informative and engaging manner. attending such lectures allows students to genuinely benefit without feeling their time was squandered.\nMoreover, universities often schedule lectures throughout the entire day. Furthermore, many university students work to support themselves financially during their studies. These students need to work part-time. Thus, students must balance lecture attendance, study time, and working hours. Simultaneously, instead of attending uninspiring lectures, students can engage in other activities such as debates, swimming competitions, basketball, and more. As a result, this allows them to meet peers from different universities and form connections. \nIn summary, although a few exceptional lecturers provide highly informative lectures, many others bore students and waste their time. students entering university are already mentally and physically mature. they possess the judgment to decide what is necessary for them.

{"id": "id_160", "input": "The debate over the suitable retirement age is becoming increasingly prevalent in society. Some people believe individuals should have the freedom to decide when to retire, while others disagree. From my perspective, the ideal retirement age should be approximately 60 years old. Personally, I fully support the idea of imposing an age criterion for retirement at the stated age, and I will discuss several reasons for this view below.\nTo begin with, if older employees continue to occupy the workforce, it reduces job openings for recent graduates. Consequently, many of these graduates may end up in careers vastly different from their field of study. To further elaborate, a medical student might feel frustrated after dedicating five years to studying medicine, only to find themselves in a different career due to a lack of job opportunities. Additionally, the absence of genuine enthusiasm for a job they didn't choose may lead to a decline in their work performance.\nMoreover, not all older employees are in good physical health. Beyond this age, many face an increased risk of developing health issues such as stress-related disorders and heart diseases. For instance, the stressful conditions faced by an aging teacher can significantly impact their well-being. As a result, they may be unable to perform optimally in their roles. Furthermore, the educational institution may have to cover their medical expenses, leading to financial losses. Therefore, it would be advantageous to provide opportunities for younger individuals at an advanced age.\nGranted, the expertise of retired senior workers should never be underestimated. Their invaluable knowledge and experience in fields like engineering, medicine, and law can greatly benefit younger generations. Therefore, it is advisable for retirees to visit companies or hospitals regularly to share their insights with current staff and bridge the knowledge gap.\nIn summary, it is clear that a retirement age limit should be established. There comes a point when the older generation should transfer responsibilities to the newcomers eager to prove themselves. Ultimately, retirement not only signifies the end of one's career but also provides an opportunity to reclaim what was lost during their working years.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay101", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 217, "to": 278}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 294, "to": 378}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 451, "to": 548}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 564, "to": 652}], "label": "Claim", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 676, "to": 846}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 862, "to": 972}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 984, "to": 1035}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1037, "to": 1161}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1177, "to": 1269}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1284, "to": 1338}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1353, "to": 1450}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1463, "to": 1555}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1566, "to": 1636}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1638, "to": 1765}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1778, "to": 1920}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1934, "to": 1995}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 15}], "edges": [{"source": 3, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 3, 11, 12, 15]}

Technological advancements have indeed helped humans solve numerous problems; however, they have also taken away some aspects of life we once cherished. From my perspective, life in earlier times offered more happiness to people than it does today for several reasons.\nThe first reason is life was simpler in the past. In today's world, everyone is in constant competition with each other. As the global population is increasing, competition is becoming more intense. If you can't manage your responsibilities, you will be quickly replaced. Individuals must exert much more effort to maintain their standard of living. Consequently, life in past times was simpler than it is now.\nSecondly, today's environment is severely damaged. When I look out the window, I don't see the sky, trees, or mountains, but rather imposing high-rise buildings. Every day, I walk on hard pavements, breathe polluted air, and live in cramped spaces. Even worse, it has been demonstrated that living in such conditions can lead to mental health issues. As a result, our grandparents lived in a more comfortable environment compared to today.\nThe third reason is the speed of life. Today, we have access to global news, can communicate with others online, and travel worldwide by air; however, it means that any global event can impact our lives. If we fail to respond swiftly and appropriately, we may find ourselves in a precarious position. We are compelled to live at a rapid pace.\nIn summary, while there a few people live in relatively good conditions, but they are a small minority.

In this essay, I will examine both perspectives before arriving at a well-founded conclusion.\nTo start, proponents of the notion that universities are impractical have several points. They argue that there are plenty of job opportunities available for individuals without a university degree, such as in fields like mechanics, sales, or engineering, and, in addition, the demand for graduates in the workforce is limited. Even more concerning, the job market for highly educated individuals has become so competitive that finding employment after graduation is challenging. In this context, it reduces national productivity when young people spend excessive time seeking high-paying jobs, which can be a significant waste of time.\nConversely, opponents argue that universities equip individuals with not only career-specific skills but also broader academic knowledge that benefits humanity, including fields like bioscience, politics, and medicine. This academic knowledge is essential for global advancement. Moreover, many groundbreaking discoveries and achievements in modern society have originated from university research. Another important aspect of universities is that the diverse experiences gained during campus life can greatly enhance the competence of young individuals because there are numerous opportunities through internships, in-depth discussions, independent living, and exchange scholarships.\nIn conclusion, both arguments regarding the necessity of university education have valid points; however, I align with the latter perspective.

Colleges and universities play a vital role in equipping individuals with the academic skills needed to achieve their goals. A contentious issue arises around whether this opportunity should be reserved for high-achieving students or whether everyone should have the chance to acquire advanced skills from higher education institutions. This discussion will explore the issue.\nFirst and foremost, many believe that colleges and universities should admit students only if they excel academically. The rationale behind this is that pursuing higher education requires a significant financial investment. These institutions do not want unqualified individuals squandering money and time on costly courses. They contend that only high-performing students are more likely to succeed in these programs than those not deemed as good students. As a result, average students have less chance of acquiring advanced knowledge from colleges and universities.\nConversely, some argue that every student should have equal access to higher education. Certainly, higher education requires substantial time and financial resources, yet average students deserve the chance to attempt. Individuals with strong ambition can achieve their goals even if they are not initially categorized as high achievers because people can change.

Personally, I am inclined to oppose this view. \nTo begin with, many students become overly engrossed in online computer games, leading to a decline in their academic performance. A study conducted by Beijing University indicates that 80% of students who failed their final exams spent 2 hours or more weekly on online games, whereas 90% of top-performing students reported avoiding computer games most days. Recent scientific research also suggests that younger individuals are more prone to becoming captivated by and losing themselves in these computer games due to their limited self-control. \nAdditionally, children gain no meaningful knowledge from these computer games, hence spending time on such activities is indeed a waste. Given that these games are predominantly created for commercial gains and to attract children's attention, the majority of these games incorporate themes of war, violence, gore, or sexual content to entice students. Nonetheless, such themes are inappropriate for students and can negatively impact the youth. \nWhile it is true that a small number of students who devote substantial time to playing computer games eventually pursue careers related to them, it is important to acknowledge: most students fail to resist the allure of computer games, opting to use time meant for studying, sleeping, and physical activities for gaming instead. It's not unusual to find teenagers staying awake for days playing online games at public internet cafes, with media reports highlighting cases of sudden death among teens in these venues. \nUltimately, I am convinced it would be preferable for children to be restricted from playing computer games.

Furthermore, it should, to a certain degree, be guiding to prevent students from shying away from challenges.\nTo start with, students need to identify one or more disciplines that truly capture their interest.

Foundational education is crucial for the advancement of specialized studies. For instance, although science is increasingly specialized, solving problems often requires integrating knowledge from chemistry and physics. Moreover, even though while textbooks at the university level are categorized by specific subjects, they actually necessitate a basic grasp of various disciplines. For instance, reading a chemistry text can sometimes require an understanding of physics. Consequently, high school learners should receive a well-rounded education to lay the groundwork for university studies.\nFinally, students often tend to avoid challenging content.

These differences are influenced by the effort students put into their studies. This is not the teachers' responsibility. Therefore, teachers' salaries should not be determined by the test scores of their students.\nFinally, compensating teachers based on student grades could result in significant issues. This problem affects educational quality. Teachers might neglect the importance of teaching in a way that ensures student comprehension. Educators might inflate grades to secure higher pay. Such issues should be avoided. Hence, student grades should not be used as a criterion for evaluating teachers.\nIn summary, I strongly oppose the idea that teachers' salaries should be tied to their students' learning achievements because teachers cannot give individual attention to each student in a classroom.

{"id": "id_174", "input": "In today's world, everyone is familiar with the term 'globalization', which signifies a closer connection among countries, with each nation influencing others in numerous ways more than ever. Therefore, both governmental and non-governmental organizations focus on fostering harmony and providing assistance to impoverished nations. It is indeed true that simply providing aid to poorer countries might be manipulated by powerful nations. Moreover, a significant amount of resources and funds have led to corruption and political dependency in poor countries on other nations. Nonetheless, I assert that supporting impoverished nations brings positive impacts that outweigh its drawbacks for several reasons.\nFirstly, impoverished nations face a lack of essential resources and infrastructure necessary to initiate businesses and enhance their wealth. Escaping poverty requires backing for fundamental industries through elements like electricity, transportation, resources, technology, and company facilities. Providing aid to nations in such conditions helps resolve their economic issues and enables them to operate their own enterprises. In fact, In the 1960s, South Korea was among the poorest countries, even when compared to some African nations. Today, it stands as a strong economy, aiding other poor countries, attributed to a decade of international assistance.\nSecondly, aid campaigns provide an opportunity to empathize with the less fortunate. When individuals from affluent nations consider the hardships of those suffering from poverty and illness, they are less likely to take their prosperity for granted. This not only highlights the significance of harmony and compassion but also serves as a valuable lesson in the humanitarian principles of globalization.\nThirdly, such campaigns could entail tangible benefits. In a globalized era, the intertwined economies of different countries significantly impact one another. For example, when the US mortgage system failed, it caused economic instability in several European and Asian countries, leading to some requiring international assistance to prevent bankruptcy.\nIn summary, there are three primary positive effects of aid: empowering poor nations to strengthen their economies, fostering humanitarian values, and maintaining a robust global economy. I firmly believe that being a global partner by assisting impoverished nations will continue through the efforts of numerous organizations and volunteers, enhancing the world as a better place for all.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay032", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 356, "to": 437}], "label": "Claim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 449, "to": 575}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 604, "to": 707}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 718, "to": 850}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 852, "to": 1009}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1011, "to": 1140}], "label": "Claim", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1151, "to": 1252}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1254, "to": 1371}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1383, "to": 1456}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1458, "to": 1622}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1624, "to": 1776}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1787, "to": 1832}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1834, "to": 1936}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1938, "to": 2131}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2145, "to": 2319}], "label": "Claim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2343, "to": 2521}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 15}], "edges": [{"source": 5, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 15]}

Personally, I hold the view that violence in movies adversely impacts young people, particularly affecting their behavior, emotions, and academic performance.\nTo begin with, children's behavior is a major concern for parents, who strive to do their utmost. Today, children are more engaged with television shows. Consider a scenario where a child's favorite actor plays violent roles. In such a situation, the child might mimic the actor's actions to resemble them. Consequently, unexpectedly, violent behavior has an influence on the child's conduct.\nMoreover, humans, especially young people, are highly impressionable.

Hence, if such scenes are shown on TV, they are likely to negatively impact viewers, particularly children.\nLastly, in addition to all the factors mentioned above, the education of young people should always be monitored. For instance, a child watches a horror movie. Conversely, he needs to prepare for an exam. In such a scenario, because he is preoccupied with thoughts about the movie and its events, it is clear that he will have difficulty focusing on his studies.

{"id": "id_180", "input": "The debate over whether attending classes should be mandatory for university students is quite intriguing, as it impacts a vast number of students globally. Nevertheless, there are numerous policies concerning this issue. A key consideration might be whether the aim is to maximize the acquired knowledge or the range of valuable experiences for students. In my opinion, students should have the autonomy to decide not to attend classes since it enhances students' quality of life and boosts their motivation to learn while also imparting vital life skills.\nTo begin with, a flexible policy is highly practical. Monitoring attendance entails significant bureaucratic effort. Particularly in larger classes, it's unfeasible to verify everyone's presence. Thus, allowing voluntary attendance conserves both time and resources.\nMoreover, certain students may find they learn more effectively at home, perhaps by studying textbooks. This issue is particularly prevalent when the lecturer lacks enthusiasm. Allowing students to opt-out of classes provides them an escape from poor teaching. Consequently, they can make better use of their study time by engaging with the course material on their own.\nFurthermore, having the choice to skip classes enhances students' flexibility and overall life quality. Occasionally, a memorable Thursday night party shouldn\u2019t be cut short just for a Friday morning lecture. With a more relaxed policy, students can defer their learning to later in the day, which promotes a sense of freedom and better time management. Studies indicate that student satisfaction with life aspects correlates with improved academic performance.\nFinally, psychology distinguishes between two kinds of motivation. Intrinsic motivation arises from one\u2019s internal mindset, whereas extrinsic motivation is derived from external recognition and praise. Intrinsic motivation is significantly more favorable as it results in enhanced learning and well-being. On the other hand, students must recognize their strengths and objectives to cultivate intrinsic motivation.

{"id": "id_181", "input": "Transportation is a significant topic of social interest today. There is ongoing debate about whether governments should allocate more funds to traffic infrastructure or place a stronger emphasis on enhancing public transportation. It seems reasonable to propose that governments should invest more in the infrastructure for buses, trains, and subways. These public modes of transport cater to a large segment of the population, thus they contribute to easing traffic congestion and reducing carbon emissions. Both aspects hold importance.\nPrimarily, reducing carbon emissions is crucial for protecting our atmosphere. It is evident that an increase in cars and motorcycles on the roads exacerbates the damage to the ozone layer. If governments prioritize road improvements, it might encourage more individuals to drive their private cars. This will likely result in higher carbon emissions, potentially leading to skin cancer and harming the natural environment. However, when there are better buses, trains, or subways available, people tend to use fewer personal vehicles, thereby reducing carbon emissions. Clearly, focusing financial resources on public transportation development positively impacts the planet. \nMoreover, this policy would significantly help alleviate traffic congestion. It is evident that traffic jams are a significant issue in many large cities. This issue is mainly due to the fact that the roads are crowded with numerous vehicles. To address the problem, governments must encourage the public to shift towards using public transportation to cut down on cars and motorcycles. Enhancing roads and highways may not address the root cause of traffic congestion.\nIn summary, I acknowledge that well-maintained roads and highways facilitate easier movement. Nonetheless, public transport systems offer even greater benefits. They not only reduce traffic congestion but also help in safeguarding the environment.

Being naturally introverted, I find myself needing to invest significant time and energy in adapting to new environments and especially unfamiliar people. On one occasion, while collaborating on a presentation with strangers, I ended up working in isolation and completed over half of the task myself rather than attempting to connect with unfamiliar individuals. As a result, my efficiency improves when my work style aligns with my temperament.\nAdditionally, working solo enables me to bypass the time and effort spent on aspects inherent to teamwork. Put simply, I don't have to allocate roles and responsibilities among team members, share accountability and rewards, or dedicate time to team-building. These benefits are particularly crucial when time is scarce. About a year ago, I had the fortunate opportunity to join a student brainstorming competition.

Nevertheless, I believe that modern technology is fostering the development of a unified contemporary culture for several reasons.\nTo begin with, the majority of nations have adopted similar educational systems driven by technology. Educators assign topics to students, who then utilize the internet for research, type their findings on a computer, and even present their work using PowerPoint. For instance, students in Iran use the same Microsoft software for typing assignments and giving presentations as their counterparts in Canada.\nMoreover, advancements in technology have led to the creation of similar job opportunities globally. Computer-related careers are expanding in numerous countries, with students being encouraged to pursue studies in this area. For instance, many immigrants in Canada with degrees in computer technology can easily enroll in Canadian universities and secure well-paying jobs. This example illustrates that technology-related occupations are highly sought after in many nations.\nSome may contend that certain cultural elements, like traditional cuisines, remain unique to each culture and are less susceptible to technological influence. At first glance, this argument seems valid; however, countries such as Canada, the USA, and the UK boast numerous restaurants offering a variety of international cuisines. Actually, chefs can easily access a wide array of new recipes online. For instance, two days ago, I visited a Canadian restaurant and enjoyed dishes like noodles and sushi, which are Chinese, as well as a Greek salad.\nIn conclusion, technology has significantly influenced global cultures, leading to notable similarities across different cultures.

I do not share this perspective.\nI acknowledge that tourism can negatively affect the natural environment. To cater to tourists' demands, local authorities often construct additional facilities and infrastructure near tourist sites, potentially leading to the destruction of natural habitats. Tourism also contributes to increased pollution and waste, including higher emissions of greenhouse gases, discarded waste, and excessive use of water, energy, and other resources in luxury hotels. Given these points, it appears that tourism places significant stress on ecosystems and local resources, and should not be promoted.\nNevertheless, thriving tourism can greatly benefit the local economy. Tourists traveling abroad will not only spend on entry fees to attractions but also on food, lodging, transport, and entertainment. This allows local communities and governments to generate substantial income, and it also creates more job opportunities. Additionally, I am convinced that the revenue generated from tourism can be reinvested to reduce pollution and safeguard the environment.\nMoreover, the growing tourism industry is also advantageous for travelers. Direct flight options enable travelers to journey with ease and comfort. With ample local services and facilities, travelers can devote more of their vacation time to enjoyment and relaxation.

{"id": "id_185", "input": "There are numerous viewpoints when it comes to hobbies. Some individuals prefer watching television. Nonetheless, from my perspective, reading fiction provides more enjoyment than viewing films for several reasons.\nTo begin with, fiction literature tends to offer more detailed descriptions. Indeed, we can gain a deep understanding of the characters, settings, and timelines within a novel during the reading process. Most novels delve into not only the protagonists but also other characters, along with the settings of each scene. For instance, after reading 'Animal Farm', which narrates the story of the Russian Revolution, I was able to grasp the roles of the leaders and various societal groups in Russia. Conversely, a film merely provides a brief overview of its plot and characters.\nMoreover, reading a novel offers greater flexibility. Some novels consist of around 100 pages, making it impossible for readers to finish them within an hour. However, individuals can continue reading wherever they find spare moments, such as on buses or trains. As an illustration, I embarked on reading a novel last week. I lack the time to finish a novel in a single day, so I usually read while commuting home from English class. On the other hand, I am unable to sit through an entire movie because I can only manage to watch TV for about 15 minutes before needing to study.\nSome might contend that people derive enjoyment from watching television when they realize they have the opportunity to learn various things, like acquiring a new language, by watching films. This argument holds some validity on the surface; nevertheless, films are not the ideal medium for language acquisition for beginners since the dialogue in films is often rapid and unclear for those learning a language.

Many argue that TV can adversely affect children due to its violent or unsuitable content. Nonetheless, I firmly assert that television offers more benefits than drawbacks. My viewpoint is backed by two reasons.\nTo begin with, television provides valuable and educational content. Alongside current affairs, there are numerous educational programs available. Children can gain a wealth of knowledge if they utilize these programs effectively. For instance, in Korea, a program known as EBS exists. It caters to audiences ranging from children to teenagers. EBS lectures enable us to study various subjects. Additionally, Numerous documentaries, such as those about notable figures in Korea, are available. Engaging with educational programs provides inspiration rather than negative impacts. \nFurthermore, Television serves as a stress reliever. There are various TV shows, including sports programs. Many children today experience significant stress, as They face immense academic pressure. Watching sports programs can effectively alleviate this stress. For example, I was overwhelmed by school-related stress. Thus, I became quite aggressive, yet. Watching the soccer match between Korea and Japan completely relieved my stress.

However, learning with a teacher can sometimes feel overwhelming due to homework assignments, yet, I prefer learning with a teacher over studying alone. \nFirstly, one significant aspect of having a teacher is the ability to ask questions about study-related issues. To put it differently, when we encounter challenges in our studies that we can't resolve, consulting our teacher is a beneficial way to address them immediately.

Consequently, In my class, I frequently discuss issues with my teacher to arrive at a well-coordinated solution, and my classmates are also used to interacting with the teacher. \nSecondly, in my opinion, learning with a teacher proves to be more efficient than learning independently. We can complete our tasks with minimal assistance from a teacher in less time than doing it alone. Additionally, teachers play a crucial role in guiding us in the right direction. Moreover, This provides an opportunity to significantly enhance our educational level. knowledge can thus be better enhanced and solidified.\nFinally, undoubtedly, studying without a teacher has its drawbacks.

Numerous medical advancements, such as treatments for cancer and HIV, have been discovered through animal testing. Although many researchers assert that this is essential for enhancing human health, I contend that primates should be granted the same rights as humans.\nThere are multiple arguments for why animal testing ought to be prohibited. To begin with, the disadvantages surpass the advantages. Each year, countless animals are killed by cosmetic companies, farms, or medical schools for product testing, often without any positive outcome. Animal experimentation demands a significant financial investment, because animals need to be fed, cared for, and administered drugs or experimental compounds.\nMoreover, animals are housed in artificial environments. Recent research indicates poor treatment and neglect of animals, affecting their drug responses. In March 2003, a lab technician captured footage inside a laboratory, showing primates in cages without pain relief, including a baboon with a metal cylinder affixed to its head. As a result, I argue that the act of sacrificing animals is both costly and distressing.\nAnother point to consider is that many ethical and genetic standards are violated when animals are used for testing. A large number of people concur that inflicting pain on animals is not only inhumane and harsh but also deceptive, as responses to drugs can differ between animals and humans.

Television is one of these resources; however, it can have adverse effects on some people. Therefore, I am convinced that Television has eroded communication among friends and family. Some individuals devote substantial time to watching television, some even eat while watching, and for others, this medium becomes a priority.\nTo begin with, some individuals allocate a significant amount of time to watching television. Instead of spending time with family and friends, they prefer to sit in front of the TV for hours. I know someone who, before even having breakfast, turns on the TV every morning and records the shows he misses during work. Occasionally, his wife wishes to converse before heading to work, but he only allows her to speak during the commercials. Consequently, she has become so accustomed to his routine that she opts to email him instead. Family time is invaluable, and people need to recognize this and dedicate quality moments to converse with them.\nAnother way television has hindered communication is when people cannot even sit down for dinner with their family. Dinner time is when, if they have kids, they can discuss everything about school, projects, and even their concerns. Additionally, during dinner with friends, some struggle to maintain a flowing conversation because the television once again stands between them. When family or friends gather to enjoy a meal and conversation, this isn't the reality for some.\nIn conclusion, some people prioritize television over other activities.

Raised in times of hardship, likely due to war, the older generation tends to view the world negatively and pessimistically. Their deeply ingrained sense of misery makes them resistant to change, or more precisely, unwilling to embrace modernity. For instance, many prefer manually assembling machine parts over trusting robots, doubting their efficiency and safety compared to human skills.\nSecondly, their lack of responsiveness is linked to their outlook on life. Put differently, They are aware of their declining health and lack of enthusiasm, which aligns with their preference for routine and secure ideologies. This is completely overshadowed by the adventurous spirit and courage of the youth. Clearly, the success of numerous companies is driven by young people, whose innovative ideas are seen as refreshing and in tune with global trends.\nFinally, knowledge plays a crucial role in young workers surpassing their older counterparts. Employers would likely opt for a young individual proficient in both fundamental subjects and skills like programming and foreign languages over an older person with outdated education. While not to disparage older workers, their lack of expertise in essential modern fields results in their ineffectiveness in today's workplaces.\nIn summary, workers above 50 have shown themselves to be inferior to younger generations in every respect.

Due to its accessibility and captivating programs, television draws viewers from all ages and backgrounds. The issue of children becoming addicted to TV has sparked significant debate over whether their viewing time should be restricted. Personally, I believe that children should be prohibited from excessive television or movie watching.\nTo begin with, children typically have weak self-discipline, leading them to easily waste time. Prolonged TV watching without completing homework is a major concern for many parents. As a child, I was a typical example of this. Every day after coming home from school, my first action was to turn on the TV and watch it for hours. I could sit in front of the TV for hours, yet struggled to focus on homework for even a few minutes. I was able to remember every channel's schedule, but couldn't recall anything from my textbooks. Consequently, my academic performance suffered greatly due to insufficient studying.\nFurthermore, Television programs often contain violence and sexual content, which can be detrimental to children. Children lack the maturity to discern between what is beneficial and harmful, and as a result, they are prone to mimicking TV behaviors out of curiosity. Recently, there has been an increase in children smoking because they copy the actions of actors seen on TV or in movies. Even more concerning, Statistics show a growing number of children with violent tendencies, often linked to TV programs and films. Clearly, many TV shows and movies negatively impact children's mental and physical well-being. How can we expect children to perform well academically if they exhibit such problematic behaviors?\nSome argue, in terms of social interactions with peers, that the diverse content of TV and movies can provide children with topics to discuss. I partially agree with this perspective.

Personally, I am inclined to disagree with this viewpoint, as I believe other elements are contributing to the slight rise in violence levels.\nOn one hand, I concur that law enforcement officers are entrusted with the duty of addressing violence in both urban and suburban zones, often utilizing firearms. A notable instance of this occurred in the United States, where a man murdered over ten individuals in a theater using a firearm, while the police incapacitated him by shooting him in the leg. Clearly, police can compel offenders to surrender, because they possess weapons that thwart the escape of criminals who pose a significant threat to society. Consequently, it is essential to encourage the use of certain military-grade weapons by police to safeguard the public and reduce violence rates.\nConversely, there are several reasons why the level of violence is surging dramatically within communities. Firstly, unemployment rates have climbed to 15 percent in numerous globalized and non-globalized nations. Many highly qualified and educated individuals struggle to earn enough money to live comfortably. Secondly, living expenses in major cities are exorbitant, compelling those below the poverty line to resort to desperate measures to meet their basic needs. Numerous beggars, for example, resort to pickpocketing on public transportation.\nIn summary, it appears to me that the firearms employed by police are not the catalyst for the heightened violence levels. Nevertheless, certain issues like unemployment play a pivotal role in fostering criminal behavior within communities.

Personally, I propose approaching this issue differently. Advertising is essential for society, but it is crucial for us to manage the content and the types of goods and services we wish to present to our customers.\nTo begin with, I endorse the notion that the promotion of alcohol, cigarettes, and products or services with adult content should be restricted because such advertisements can adversely affect our children. Young people may feel inclined to purchase cigarettes or alcohol, potentially developing a habitual use over time. Fortunately, some nations have adopted stringent measures and have prohibited the advertising of alcohol, cigarettes, and adult materials.\nConversely, advertising enables companies, businesses, and even individuals to promote their products and services. Advertisements provide us with insights into new offerings, allowing us to evaluate and select the most suitable options.\nNowadays, advertising is not only crucial for numerous businesses but also for governments. For instance, tourism constitutes a significant portion of the Czech Republic's economic activity. To showcase the nation's attractions, the Czech government must market and offer its services to international audiences.

Some argue that curbing the need for people to be on the streets is the only way to tackle the seemingly insurmountable problem of traffic jams. However, I must strongly disagree, as there are still two promising alternatives to this approach.\nFirstly, public transportation plays a crucial role in reducing the number of vehicles on the roads. Buses and trains have been in operation on the streets for a considerable period and have demonstrated their effectiveness as the best options available. Clearly, a bus can accommodate at least 30 passengers, while a train can hold nine to ten times that amount. Furthermore, the fact that high-speed trains run underground allows the streets above to be used by buses and eco-friendly vehicles. Collectively, these measures will alleviate the overcrowded conditions prevalent in most cities today.\nSecondly, we often overlook the beneficial presence of suburban areas. It is thought that relocating some of the massive shopping centers or universities to the outskirts would make city streets less bustling and overcrowded. Generally speaking, distributing major attractions across a broad area means that residential zones will follow, thereby reducing the strain on public services. The city will be relieved from the burden of handling an influx of migrants and unemployed individuals.\nIn conclusion, urban planners can still consider alternatives such as promoting public transport and developing suburban areas.

{"id": "id_201", "input": "Teaching can be approached in numerous ways. Some advocate for the idea that meticulously presenting theories in the classroom is the optimal teaching method, whereas others contend that incorporating practical applications of these theories is more persuasive. Personally, I support the latter viewpoint that the most effective way for educators to engage students in a subject is by illustrating its relevance and applicability to their lives outside the classroom.\nTo begin with, when students understand how a subject impacts their everyday life, they develop a vivid impression of it, thereby becoming more enthusiastic and proactive in learning about it. Consider chemistry, for instance; simply memorizing substance names and structural formulas can be quite dull, but showing students where and how these chemical reactions occur around them sparks curiosity and encourages them to absorb the theories taught in class. During my time in high school, my chemistry teacher demonstrated how detergent dissolves oil with an experiment, and subsequently taught us to describe this process using formal structural formulas. This approach to learning is more engaging and ultimately yields positive outcomes. I linked the visual aspects of the experiment to the formula, and I rarely forget it, even though I am no longer studying chemistry.\nFurthermore, connecting theories to everyday occurrences offers students the opportunity to apply what they've learned and hone their problem-solving skills.

Living in a competitive world is akin to participating in a survival game. Only those equipped with the sharpest tools can endure. Failing to make yourself exceptional or distinguishable from peers means you risk being easily replaced by someone more capable. Consider my own experience: during my college years, I was consistently selected as the presenter for group projects because I was the sole member who could deliver the presentation comprehensively and smoothly.\nAdditionally, being unique allows you to establish an individual value that others cannot replicate. Put differently, When you possess uniqueness, chasing success involves actively setting trends rather than waiting for others' recognition and admiration. Consider Apple, the most renowned and esteemed technology company. The key to its vast success lies in its ability to achieve exceptional qualities that rivals cannot match. Its operating systems offer smoother performance than competitors, and its design consistently captures consumer favor.

My perspective is grounded in the belief that every tough experience enhances our skills, sharpens our decision-making, and makes us more adaptable to life.\nA prime illustration is how infants acquire basic survival skills during their early years. Every day presents new hurdles for them like walking, eating, etc., but these early life challenges impart essential survival skills that benefit them throughout life. For instance, when they attempt to walk, they trip and injure themselves repeatedly. However, they gradually refine their technique and master walking.\nAll discoveries and innovations stem from numerous unfortunate observations. No scientist has succeeded on their first try. Scientists experiment with numerous specimens before achieving their goals. It is said that Thomas Edison tested approximately 10,000 bulbs before successfully inventing the light bulb. Thus, all the initial trials must have been tough and discouraging for him, yet he explored more possibilities and gained new insights with each attempt, ultimately leading to his breakthrough.\nOur challenging experiences unknowingly fortify and strengthen us. We might be enduring the hardest phase of our lives at the moment, but reflecting on those times later instills greater confidence in our choices and ourselves.

Firstly, we must recognize that expanding the reach of these languages by the government could be quite costly, since educational programs will need to be implemented to ensure young people continue learning and using them.

Furthermore, it's clear that it would be much more convenient for society as a whole to operate using a single language in matters like communication, trade, cooperation, and transactions.\nDespite the previous points, I firmly hold the belief that the government should strive to maintain minority languages.

{"id": "id_209", "input": "Perhaps, there is no topic more crucial to individuals than the preparation of food, as it impacts everyone daily. Some argue that individuals should devote significant time to food preparation. Nevertheless, I contend that people are likely to spend less time in cooking food. There are several reasons for my position, with two standing out prominently.\nThe foremost reason is that with advancements in science and technology, cutting-edge kitchen appliances, such as modern microwaves or advanced pressure cookers, have been developed to assist people in preparing and cooking meals quickly. Consequently, today, individuals can prepare a meal in just one hour instead of the two or three hours required a decade ago. Indeed, in recent years, there has been a notable rise in the number of people from various backgrounds recognizing the benefits of these technologies in household chores. And this trend continues to grow as science and technology advance. Therefore, it is evident that dedicating less time to cooking will become a dominant trend in the near future.\nAnother reason is that most young people prefer dining out at restaurants because they wish to allocate more time to their work or studies for self-improvement. A recent survey indicates that 89% of individuals believe that due to the competitive and high-pressure environments they face, they must dedicate considerable time to hard work, continuous learning, and skill acquisition. As a result, they find it challenging to allocate time for meal preparation and cooking. Even with some leisure time, they prefer socializing with friends to unwind and alleviate stress from work and study.\nSome might claim that spending ample time cooking ensures the nutritional value and quality of family meals. This is partially accurate. However, in reality, using technology or advanced equipment does not diminish the nutritional value or quality of food. Moreover, ozone machines can eliminate and remove bacteria, mold spores, and pesticides from vegetables, fruits, and other foods, ensuring that the health and well-being of consumers are protected. Furthermore, with a high standard of living, quality control in most restaurants today is rigorously monitored by relevant authorities. Thus, it is relatively easy to enjoy a nutritious, high-quality meal without spending excessive time.\nIn conclusion, when all factors are considered, it is evident that there are numerous strong reasons to back my perspective.

Traditionally, individuals have pursued a single career path as a means to sustain themselves. However, a contemporary trend shows that newer generations are increasingly inclined to engage in multiple jobs and seek various advanced educational qualifications to enhance their income and achieve financial stability.\nIn the past, a full-time position with a reliable salary sufficed for employees to provide for themselves and their families. However, due to the recent economic downturn, virtually every nation is experiencing substantial economic decline. This pervasive crisis is leading to workforce downsizing and job cuts. Consequently, individuals are increasingly choosing to take on multiple jobs or pursue additional qualifications to improve their economic situation.\nFurthermore, the advent of technology has significantly contributed to rising unemployment rates. This phenomenon is officially termed \"Technological Unemployment.\" After analyzing the prevailing economic conditions in America, North American economists have reported that technology is eliminating more jobs than it is creating. For instance, machines, automation, and software are replacing human workers in roles such as clerks, translators, security personnel, retail workers, and particularly in manufacturing sectors. Therefore, a large number of individuals now face the risk of losing their jobs. Securing multiple jobs is the most effective strategy to guarantee adaptable income. Lastly, the policy of corporations to pay lower wages to subordinate staff is another factor pushing workers to diversify into different fields.\nConsidering all these factors, I am convinced that people are increasingly aware of the need to obtain more educational qualifications and show greater interest in working across various domains simultaneously to increase their earnings and support themselves.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay132", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 441, "to": 565}], "label": "Premise", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 576, "to": 680}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 682, "to": 751}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 767, "to": 901}], "label": "Claim", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 916, "to": 999}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1068, "to": 1231}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1247, "to": 1425}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1438, "to": 1506}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1508, "to": 1591}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1601, "to": 1736}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1789, "to": 1997}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 10}], "edges": [{"source": 3, "target": 0, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [3, 8, 10]}

Lately, some individuals contend that the government should allocate more funds to healthcare and education instead of entertainment or sports venues. From my perspective, this proposition holds greater societal benefits.\nAddressing the needs of countless citizens affected by illness or lacking education is a more pressing and practical concern than constructing theaters or sports arenas. Indeed, an individual without education might not fully appreciate cultural performances, while someone physically impaired due to inadequate medical care might be unable to engage in sports activities. Consequently, it is more crucial for the government to prioritize education and healthcare.\nFacilities for entertainment like cinemas, theaters, and sports arenas primarily aim to generate profits. Their existence depends on marketing strategies, the quality of amenities, and audience size. Competition among these facilities is a natural aspect of the free market that shouldn't be disrupted by government intervention. In contrast, establishing healthcare or educational institutions is meant to enhance standards of health or education, not to generate profits, thus warranting more government funding.\nMoreover, using taxpayer money to construct theaters or sports arenas is unjust to those who cannot benefit from them. For instance, not everyone enjoys attending musical performances in person. Thus, it seems somewhat inappropriate to allocate the majority of taxpayers' money to satisfy the desires of a small group. This explains why areas like healthcare and education merit increased government backing, because these services are used by every member of society daily.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that funding should be directed more towards healthcare and education rather than the construction of entertainment facilities, as the former is more vital, not driven by profit motives, and accessible to the majority of the population.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay065", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 136, "to": 247}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 320, "to": 488}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 498, "to": 691}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 707, "to": 783}], "label": "Claim", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 785, "to": 889}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 891, "to": 983}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 985, "to": 1113}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1128, "to": 1298}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1310, "to": 1417}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1433, "to": 1493}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1501, "to": 1617}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1637, "to": 1707}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1717, "to": 1773}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1812, "to": 1933}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1938, "to": 2042}], "label": "Claim", "id": 14}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 3, 4, 11, 13, 14]}

{"id": "id_216", "input": "Have you ever encountered a bear or monkey in real life? If you have, it was likely at a zoo. Zoos are sprawling outdoor environments where various animal species are housed for people to observe, learn from, and admire. Many individuals argue that zoos serve no purpose or are futile. I strongly oppose this viewpoint because I am convinced that zoos foster social interaction, provide educational opportunities, and cultivate qualities such as respect and understanding towards animals.\nVisitors to zoos often come in groups, either with family members or as part of school excursions. Within the zoo, they engage with each other, unwind while observing the animals, interact with some, share comments about their looks and behaviors, and enjoy their amusing habits. Nowadays, families don't spend as much time together as they did a few decades ago. The zoo provides an excellent opportunity for family bonding, offering an enjoyable activity for all family members, from young kids to grandparents.\nAnimals, their various species, habitats, and behaviors are topics of study in educational institutions. While books and lectures provide knowledge, there is an even more effective way to learn through visual and firsthand experience. By visiting a zoo, you can observe animals, their habits, their diets and how they consume their food, along with the distinct traits of different species. At the zoo, you can witness an animal alongside its variations, such as male and female, or juvenile and adult. It provides a valuable chance to see how they react to diverse situations like weather changes, species and gender interactions, defensive actions, or the safeguarding of their young. Furthermore, it also aids in identifying which animals might pose a threat. A trip to the zoo can enhance students' comprehension of what they are taught in school.\nUltimately, visiting a zoo can significantly boost one's respect and admiration for animals. Appreciation often increases after direct observation and learning. This is especially relevant for city dwellers, who typically only interact with pets like cats and dogs. Currently, there is a noticeable deficiency in respect for animals. Seeing animals firsthand and acquiring knowledge about them can raise awareness of their significance and the respect they merit.\nThe main objection people have against zoos is that in certain zoos, animals aren't well cared for, and the facilities are neither clean nor adequate. While this is often accurate, it doesn't pertain to the fundamental purpose of zoos.

{"id": "id_217", "input": "Even though renewable energy sources are part of the current and future energy plans, in my view, these new energy sources cannot rapidly take the place of fossil fuels like gas, oil, and coal.\nTo start with, limited technology makes renewable resources relatively costly. Research in renewable energy demands a significant financial investment that developing nations cannot bear. Conversely, fossil fuels are plentiful and low-cost in numerous regions. For instance, it's estimated that China holds the largest coal reserves globally, and the government is reluctant to heavily invest in new energy forms, like costly solar panels and wind farms. Therefore, the adoption of renewable energy resources might encounter obstacles since not all nations can afford the transition.\nMoreover, while utility companies assert that renewable energy is eco-friendly; these alternative energy sources might not be as clean and environmentally friendly as perceived. Recent research indicates that these renewable energy resources have issues and are likely to cause long-term environmental risks. For example, dams constructed for hydroelectric power alter river water flows and sometimes lead to droughts in areas upstream. This harms the ecosystems of many important fish and wading bird species. More significantly, the buildup of heavy metals in the sediment at the bottom of the rivers behind the dams is very challenging and costly to remove, creating issues for future generations. Thus, renewable resources are not as dependable as we might assume.\nCertainly, currently, fossil fuels lead to major environmental problems like acid rain, ozone layer depletion, and global warming; these issues can be addressed by enhancing system efficiency and minimizing emissions. For instance, we can use chemicals to remove sulfur from emissions from factories and vehicles to prevent acid rain. These improvement methods are often more affordable and straightforward compared to the advanced technology of renewable energy. With these solutions in place, fossil fuels appear more sustainable.\nIn summary, as appealing as renewable energy sources may seem, it's unlikely that these new energy forms will soon take over fossil fuels.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay185", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 104, "to": 192}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 209, "to": 271}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 273, "to": 380}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 394, "to": 453}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 469, "to": 647}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 660, "to": 776}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 794, "to": 856}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 858, "to": 954}], "label": "Claim", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 956, "to": 1085}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1100, "to": 1213}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1215, "to": 1287}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1309, "to": 1477}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1485, "to": 1545}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1558, "to": 1676}], "label": "Claim", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1678, "to": 1763}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1779, "to": 1880}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1882, "to": 2009}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2011, "to": 2078}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2143, "to": 2217}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 18}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 6, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 13, "target": 14, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 13, "target": 15, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 13, "target": 16, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 13, "target": 17, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 1, 7, 13, 18]}

Those who thrive are the ones who can swiftly adapt to this rapidly evolving world. Previously, mastering a single skill sufficed to tackle problems because each industry was relatively small and manageable.

For instance, nowadays, there are more opportunities to engage in business globally, so in addition to one's professional expertise, language skills have become crucial. Another example is financial crimes have become widespread in the 21st century, therefore leading to a heightened demand for individuals proficient in both legal and financial disciplines. \nFurthermore, this generation faces a unique challenge of self-discovery that previous generations did not encounter. The prior generation had less autonomy and often followed paths laid out by their parents. On the other hand, young people today are exposed to more innovative ideas and are more inclined to think independently. They are keen on discovering their identity and true desires.

Therefore, gaining knowledge about life, which aids in anticipating issues and being assertive enough to overcome them, is essential. Two primary methods for acquiring life knowledge are heeding the advice of family and friends and gaining insights through personal experience. Both approaches are beneficial as they each offer their own unique advantages.\nOn one hand, learning about life by listening to the advice of family and friends is more practical than learning through personal experiences. Family members, like your parents, possess life experience and can provide you with genuine and suitable guidance on various aspects of life. Moreover, friends, who belong to the same generation as you, understand your preferences and capabilities well enough to advise you on what suits you and what doesn't. Listening to the advice from your family and friends can help you steer clear of many unforeseen situations.\nOn the other hand, discovering life through personal experiences can foster greater independence and maturity. For one thing, there are numerous remarkable experiences you might miss out on if you don't embark on them yourself. For instance, a friend might warn you against skydiving due to its dangers. If you heed their advice, you might miss the exhilarating sensation of free-falling. Additionally, family and friends can inadvertently hinder your growth by constantly offering advice. This can lead to becoming overly dependent and reliant. Conversely, liberating yourself and pursuing your desires without worrying about the consequences is a path chosen by successful individuals.\nIn my opinion, while both approaches have merit, I favor the latter.

Parents offer crucial guidance to their children as they navigate the transitions of adult life. Sharing a home fosters an environment conducive to discussing the physiological and psychological changes experienced by adults face-to-face with their parents. Young adults may hesitate to share such issues with their parents if they live independently, thereby missing out on their parents' valuable insights.\nWhile some critics might claim that young adults residing with their parents will lack the freedom to pursue their desires.

Iin India, for instance, female students frequently secure a significant number of top positions in annual higher secondary school exams. \nMoreover, ffemale students are increasingly drawn to courses like mechanical engineering, which involve physical activities in lab workshops, unlike previous generations. Additionally, ddue to their growing awareness of current affairs and cutting-edge technological advancements, female graduates are eager to shoulder substantial responsibilities at work, despite the associated stress and pressure. For instance, CChanda Kochhar, the CEO of ICICI Bank, India's second-largest bank, is recognized as the nation's most influential female leader in the business sector. \nIn conclusion, I staunchly back the notion that eevery student, regardless of gender, should be granted equal opportunity to pursue education in all university subjects, provided they meet the necessary qualifications, rather than imposing gender-based restrictions. The government should implement temporary measures to oversee the admission process for university courses, ensuring that every student can benefit.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay140", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 147, "to": 250}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 327, "to": 463}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 475, "to": 612}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 614, "to": 750}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 763, "to": 922}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 938, "to": 1153}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1169, "to": 1321}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1372, "to": 1589}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 7}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 4, 7]}

I concur that in this scenario, it is not the government's place to intervene.\nMastery leads to excellence in artistic endeavors.

He received significant compensation for this idea.\nIn stark contrast, workers in a merchandise factory earn mere pennies even if they produce hundreds of 15 cm Buddha temples daily.

Additionally, the government cannot standardize the value of modern artists' creations because there is no definitive criterion for assessing it, art valuation is subjective.\nThat being said, the large sums modern artists earn are tied to their dedication to the art field, even though the nature of their struggle differs from other professions.

Mobile phones are indeed used extensively by individuals across various age groups. Nonetheless, I contend that this remarkable innovation of the 21st century brings about numerous issues within our society.\nFirstly, excessive time spent on mobile phones can negatively affect our social abilities. For instance, as individuals, particularly adolescents, increasingly concentrate on their phones, they may lose interest in everyday activities such as meeting friends, and this lack of interaction might hinder their negotiation and interpersonal skills in the future. Additionally, constant use of mobile phones may also cause harm to children's eyesight and physical posture. Consequently, frequent mobile phone usage can be detrimental.\nMoreover, the rise in mobile gaming could affect their mental development. For example, there is a plethora of game applications accessible online, many of which are notably aggressive. In these games, children earn rewards by helping their characters eliminate or shoot monsters or characters controlled by other players, potentially fostering aggressive emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. As a result, frequent disputes might arise during communication.\nOn the other hand, we might view this issue from alternative perspectives. Mobile phones, especially smartphones, have simplified and made communication convenient. This is because, because most telecommunications companies offer internet access through our phones, individuals can enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls without any charges. Therefore, mobile phones have bridged the gap in communication. \nIn conclusion, even though mobile phones accelerate communication, they also contribute to various social challenges, including children's social skills and mental health concerns.

Meanwhile, children have the opportunity to interact with cutting-edge technology, broadening their innovation awareness and avoiding a conservative mindset.\nNevertheless, I maintain that traditional games remain crucial in children's educational journey, arguably more so than modern games, particularly in today's world. A key advantage of traditional games is their role in enhancing children's communication abilities. In contrast to many modern games that emphasize interaction with machines, traditional games offer a relaxed and enjoyable setting where children can converse, laugh, and collaborate directly with each other. Consequently, for these children, interacting with diverse individuals will no longer pose a challenge.\nMoreover, the educational benefits of traditional games are what ensure their continued relevance today. In reality, these traditional games were meticulously crafted by educators and have consistently shown their effectiveness in enhancing children's skills across various dimensions in past educational settings. On the other hand, modern games are primarily created by gaming companies with the goal of generating profit. Thus, there is a potential danger of children encountering harmful content, like violence or pornography, included by these companies to maintain their economic viability.\nIn conclusion, I assert that traditional games should never be overlooked by parents and teachers, even with the emergence of modern games.

Although despite widespread water scarcity, many nations continue to depend solely on this resource for electricity generation. The basic resources required to produce such a large amount of energy are becoming insufficient. Consequently, there are frequent power outages in developing nations like India during the summer. If governments promote the adoption of nuclear, solar, or wind energy, the issue of distributing adequate electricity could be mitigated. Therefore, it would be a beneficial initiative by the government to harness electricity from these alternative sources.\nSecondly, the most commonly used energy sources today emit large quantities of gases, contributing to global warming. For instance, utilizing a solar cooker instead of an electric one can effectively help in reducing global warming. Similarly, using nuclear energy as a substitute for hydro-kinetic energy results in less atmospheric pollution.\nIn conclusion, it would be more advantageous for the government to advocate for alternative energy sources. This approach would capitalize on the available natural resources, thereby lowering the impact of global warming. Additionally, the government should promote and incentivize the public to adopt alternative sources such as solar and nuclear energy.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay044", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 308, "to": 356}], "label": "Premise", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 367, "to": 484}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 486, "to": 581}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 597, "to": 680}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 682, "to": 818}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 831, "to": 938}], "label": "Claim", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 950, "to": 1056}], "label": "Claim", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1072, "to": 1171}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1184, "to": 1283}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1300, "to": 1391}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1393, "to": 1505}], "label": "Claim", "id": 10}], "edges": [{"source": 3, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 0, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [5, 6, 9, 10]}

Numerous studies have demonstrated that cigarettes contain harmful substances detrimental to the human body. While many smokers argue that smoking helps them work more efficiently or think more creatively, such reasons never substantiate any health benefits of smoking. In my view, smoking should be banned, especially in public venues such as restaurants because it causes discomfort for non-smokers by polluting the air they breathe.\nTo begin with, restaurants are venues where people pay to savor their meals. Allowing smoking in restaurants undeniably disrupts others' dining experiences. Patrons cannot enjoy their meals while inhaling smoke-filled air. \nMoreover, restaurants are commonly visited by families. This implies, there are often children, elderly, and pregnant women present. Smoking in such environments sets a poor example for children. Children are highly likely to mimic the actions of adults because they possess a strong curiosity about the world around them. Smoking in restaurants can also negatively impact the health of the elderly, particularly those with heart and lung issues. Pregnant women are among the most vulnerable to smoke exposure because inhaling polluted air can hinder the development of their unborn children.\nFinally, passive smokers face numerous health hazards.

Serious films are often created to convey reflections on themes like love and humanity; furthermore, they might highlight the societal issues lurking beneath the surface.\nNext, not every serious film is dull. \"Click\" is an engaging comedy that seriously explores the balance between personal life and work commitments. The film uses humor and satire to provoke thoughts on life's true values and emphasizes the significance of family. Consequently, serious films often convey profound meanings through visuals and narratives, prompting self-reflection.\nAdditionally, some serious movies aim to provoke thoughts about the world's darker aspects. \"Blood Diamond\", based on a true story in South Africa, highlights the connection between diamonds and conflict. The film imparts a lesson about the link between gemstones and mortality. Diamonds are neither scarce nor symbols of genuine love; their underlying meaning reflects a harsh truth.

Seasoned employees can impart their valuable experience to younger colleagues who, while familiarizing themselves with their new roles, frequently offer innovative and fresh ideas. Additionally, The swift advancement in every sector today necessitates regular updates and access to recent knowledge. Consequently, young professionals are equipped to meet these expectations.

Subsequently, many eventually recognize that advancement and competition can help them enhance their abilities and broaden their perspectives. Numerous individuals relish challenging themselves because they resist becoming stagnant and uninspired. A monotonous environment soon leads to their discontent, so this scenario can negatively affect the business.\nFinally, economic downturns and financial crises lead to a substantial rise in unemployment. I contend that businesses should hire a variety of workers to address this pressing concern. It provides the unemployed with opportunities to improve their situation and earn a livelihood. Moreover, factories and companies will benefit from abundant human resources to maintain production speed and encourage innovative ideas.\nIn summary, the diverse traits of various individuals, the monotony of maintaining the same career, and addressing unemployment lead me to support the viewpoint that employers shouldn't commit to lifelong recruitment for their staff.

As evidenced, Smoking restrictions have effectively deterred the public from this harmful habit, easing the burden on the nation's healthcare system.\nUpon evaluating the prohibition of smoking in public areas in Sri Lanka, the benefits derived from this measure have been demonstrated.

{"id": "id_250", "input": "There is an ongoing debate about whether successful individuals tend to embrace risks or prefer to stick to what they already know. The complexity of this topic allows for multiple perspectives. Some argue that success comes from venturing into the unknown, while others believe in sticking to familiar territory. After considering this issue thoroughly, I have developed my own viewpoint. I align with the latter perspective, meaning successful people often continue with what they are familiar with.\nThe primary reason supporting this view is the undeniable reality that achieving success involves minimizing potential risks. The fewer obstacles to failure we face, the greater our chances of success. Consider someone who becomes wealthy due to extensive knowledge in investment. This person can focus on specific companies deemed worthwhile and enjoy steady, if modest, returns. There is no need to invest in high-risk companies that could lead to rapid financial ruin. Thus, we can start to acknowledge that successful individuals do not need to venture into the unknown or take risks.\nAdditionally, another vital factor is that success is contingent upon one's ability to make sound decisions. At the very least, a successful person should be adept at overcoming obstacles that hinder success. For example, athletes do not need to use performance-enhancing drugs to excel in their sports. Their success is attributed to their superior abilities in their respective sports. In contrast, those who attempt to boost their performance by taking risks with drugs often fail to succeed. Therefore, from this example, we can assert that it is unnecessary for successful individuals to take risks.\nAdmittedly, on the other hand, there are those who argue that taking on new challenges is essential for success because it allows individuals to differentiate themselves from others, a widely accepted notion of success. Yet, based on my understanding, I question the validity of this argument due to its recklessness. Attempting something new can indeed make someone stand out, but standing out does not necessarily equate to success. \nConsidering the reasons outlined above, I am convinced that continuing with what we already know can still lead to success because the benefits of this approach outweigh those of the alternative. Put differently, minimizing risks and enhancing individual skills is the most effective route to success. This is not to suggest that other viewpoints lack merit entirely.

I will present arguments to back my viewpoint.\nFirstly, classroom learning can enhance understanding and retention of the subjects studied. This is because classrooms are equipped with tools for demonstrating real-life examples. Take, for example, in biology classes, dissecting frogs offers significant advantages. Students can learn to handle instruments and observe actual frog organs. Unlike traditional classrooms, online courses focus solely on textbook learning, lacking real-world experiences.\nSecondly, online classes fail to impart social skills knowledge. For example, In classrooms, teachers can assign group projects to students. This helps students learn interpersonal skills and collaboration within their groups. Such critical skills are absent in online classes.\nFinally, classroom learning contributes to healthier lifestyles for students because schools offer physical education classes that encourage students to be active. Professional trainers in classrooms guide students in exercising correctly. Without guidance, students risk injuring themselves. This promotes healthier lifestyles, which online classes cannot achieve. \nIn summary, I am against the idea of replacing classroom education with online learning.

The subject of teaching financial management to young students often sparks debate. Some individuals believe that imparting money management skills to teenagers will make them appreciate the value of money, while others worry that introducing children to financial concepts at such a young age could have adverse effects. Personally, I agree that high school students should be educated about financial management.\nThe reason I believe teenagers must grasp the basics of managing money is mainly because when high school students reach the age for further studies, they often live in hostels or with friends, away from family. Learning money management early on gives them a greater sense of responsibility and confidence in such situations.. For instance, when I was young, my father kept a monthly expense log and encouraged me to do the same for managing my pocket money. This practice stayed with me and helped me plan my future expenses..\nMoreover, learning financial management early helps students understand their family's financial situation better and reduces unrealistic expectations.. For example, purchasing a gaming console may be easy for a student from a wealthy background. On the contrary, however, for a student from a middle-class family, buying a gaming console might not be a priority. Therefore, being introduced to financial management in high school aids in effectively prioritizing financial responsibilities.\nIn conclusion, I feel that students learning money management strategies will experience more benefits than drawbacks.

Consequently, certain businesses have banned smoking on their premises, and some governments have imposed restrictions on smoking in public spaces. It is commonly accepted that this initiative will yield more benefits by enhancing the nation's health standards and its long-term image.\nTo begin with, it is widely recognized and scientifically confirmed that smoking poses serious health risks to smokers and those exposed to secondhand smoke over time. Recent statistics from the Malaysian Ministry of Health indicate that lung-related diseases, primarily caused by smoking, are the leading cause of death.

For example, the government in Brunei recently enacted legislation prohibiting smoking in public areas like caf\u00e9s, hospitals, and shopping streets. This action has successfully reduced the number of smokers in the country, preserving Brunei's reputation for peace and cleanliness. This case illustrates the advantages of limiting public smoking for an entire nation.\nIn conclusion, the strategy to ban smoking in public spaces is undoubtedly contributing to reducing health risks and fostering a healthier nation.

{"id": "id_254", "input": "In recent times, the debate surrounding agricultural development has sparked controversy. While some argue that integrating advanced plant foods with newly developed devices considerably lowers the cost of producing farm products, others contend that this combination has numerous adverse effects on people's health and society.\nAdmittedly, the use of advanced fertilizers combined with automated harvesting tools boosts farmers' economic gains. This is because synthetic fertilizers enhance the yield of each acre of farmland, thereby increasing crop production, and automatic machinery improves harvesting efficiency. As a result, the expenses associated with producing and labor for each kilogram of agricultural products have significantly decreased.\nNevertheless, advanced fertilizers may pose a potential risk to people's health. Unlike organic plant foods, industrial fertilizers contain unconventional chemicals that not only modify the genetic makeup of crops but also persist within the plants.

It's not only the absence of responsibilities and daily hardships that make childhood the most joyful phase of our lives, but also elements like learning new things every day and the liberty to imagine and express your thoughts.\nOnce we reach adulthood, we are tightly bound by our responsibilities in everyday life. We are instructed on the time to wake up, the manner to dress, and the way to conduct ourselves. Every move we make is closely monitored and judged by society. However, even though responsibilities exist during childhood, there is significantly more freedom to pursue our desires. Being tardy for school or laughing in inappropriate settings does not carry consequences as severe as they would in adulthood. \nAnother wonderful aspect of being a child is the opportunity to learn new and fascinating things about the world around you daily. Being a child signifies that you are new to this world, with everything around you waiting to be discovered. There are numerous new facts to learn, stories to hear, and sights to witness. Consequently, childhood is the time when a person experiences the greatest wonder.\nUtilizing your imagination and freely voicing your thoughts is another remarkable aspect of childhood. Children are not as harshly judged for their words as adults are, and the freedom to express oneself is crucial for fostering a vibrant imagination. In adulthood, individuals are compelled to express themselves within limitations, thus they are not truly free to think creatively or utilize their imagination.\nIn many ways, childhood is the most joyful period of our existence. This is not only due to the inherent nature of childhood and children but also because of how our lives transform as we become adults.

Typically, members of the hardworking group find it challenging to allocate time for exercise. It's widely acknowledged that engaging in physical activity for at least 30 minutes daily is foundational to a healthy and joyful life. However, I believe that an equal financial commitment should not be made towards both academic resources like libraries and laboratories, and physical or social activities..\nTo begin with, I believe that allocating excessive funds for gym facilities or constructing sports courts isn't essential to motivate students to engage in physical activities. Take, for instance, my roommate, Mary, consistently wakes up at 6 AM and dedicates an hour to exercise in the nearby park. Upon returning to the dormitory, she is invigorated and, after a shower, is prepared to embrace the day. Evidently, she manages to exercise without any financial expenditure. The university's role should be to educate students on the advantages of physical activity by displaying informational posters on campus, inviting athletes to speak, and motivating students to prioritize their physical health.\nMoreover, students select their field of study based on personal interests. The university ought to equip physical education majors with the finest resources available. This is because their chosen field is deeply rooted in physical endeavors. On the other hand, for students pursuing engineering or medicine, it seems unjust to prioritize gym facilities over laboratory equipment, since advanced technology inspires students to learn innovatively and potentially discover new advancements in their respective fields.\nIn conclusion, investing in social activities can appear as a misuse of resources. students wishing to socialize or meet new people typically avoid university-organized events as their first choice. For instance, when my friends and I seek to spend quality time, we prefer locations outside of the university where we aren't likely to encounter acquaintances.\nIn summary, I acknowledge the role of sports in enhancing university students' achievements, yet I maintain that neither sports nor social activities should receive the same financial support as libraries and laboratories.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay268", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 390, "to": 553}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 585, "to": 730}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 752, "to": 853}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 855, "to": 958}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 971, "to": 1028}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1030, "to": 1255}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1267, "to": 1331}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1333, "to": 1424}], "label": "Claim", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1442, "to": 1499}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1520, "to": 1637}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1645, "to": 1773}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1790, "to": 1856}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1858, "to": 1972}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1988, "to": 2133}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2147, "to": 2226}], "label": "Claim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2248, "to": 2356}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 15}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 7, 11, 14, 15]}

{"id": "id_262", "input": "When faced with the decision of selecting accommodation post-high school graduation, students often find themselves torn between two choices: residing in an apartment or staying in university dormitories. Personally, each option comes with its own set of pros and cons. \nOn one hand, living in a dormitory allows students to immerse themselves in the university's academic atmosphere. For example, students can engage in various extracurricular activities around the campus such as participating in conversation clubs or joining sports teams. Students also have increased opportunities for interaction with faculty and peers. Moreover, students find it easier to seek assistance when facing difficulties, such as reaching out to roommates, classmates, or professors for help with math problems. In my view, living in dormitories is consistently beneficial for students. \nConversely, living off-campus equips students for real-world experiences. Take, for instance, students acquire skills like responsibility, independence, punctuality, and cooperation, which are often more pronounced than when living in dormitories. They must manage everything, including timely payment of rent and handling utility bills. Also, students must also concentrate on their studies and strive to maintain high grades. Additionally, students have the opportunity to learn about the surrounding community. Engaging with locals and building social networks prepares students for life after college. \nConsidering the evidence, it appears challenging for students to decide on their living arrangements since both types of accommodation offer distinct advantages.

While it is accurate that life evolves swiftly, the past offers numerous lessons, including errors, achievements, and insights across various academic disciplines. \nTo begin with, the errors made by those before us are the primary aspect to consider when examining the past. Since each person's lifespan is too brief to attempt anything without preparation, we should learn from others' mistakes so that we can steer clear of repeating them. Every mistake, regardless of its magnitude, is a valuable lesson, which, if utilized effectively, prepares us for life's complex challenges. Consequently, the past undeniably spares us numerous failures and valuable time.\nFurthermore, past achievements are equally as important as past mistakes. If the errors of those before us serve as an indirect path to our objectives, then the accomplishments of others provide a direct route. By studying the strategies others employed to reach their goals, we can adapt them, apply them, and achieve similar success. For example, Edison's quote \"Genius is 1 percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration\" remains relevant for everyone today and likely in the future. \nFinally, the past serves as a foundation for developing new knowledge and innovations. Without the knowledge from the past, we would not be as advanced as we are today. How could America be the leading nation if Columbus hadn't stumbled upon it while seeking India?. How could today's scientists study gravity without the apple falling on Newton's head?. These are just a few of the invaluable insights the past offers us.

{"id": "id_264", "input": "Originating in the late 1700s, industrialization and urbanization led to a dramatic rise in the number of vehicles. The fuel they depend on, oil, has since become a major source of pollution in urban areas. Critics often denounce the excessive consumption of oil, while others suggest imposing additional charges on drivers during peak hours for their self-centered behavior. However, I argue that drivers should not be subject to additional fees. The following reasons support this view. \nCapitalism has empowered individuals with the right to own property, and consequently, the right to utilize it. While driving during peak hours may indeed contribute to urban pollution, laws permit drivers to do so, and thus, imposing an extra fee on them might seem beyond legal boundaries. From a different perspective, traffic congestion is an unavoidable phenomenon that can't be entirely eliminated; therefore, it lies beyond the control of individual drivers. Why should motorists incur penalties just for using their vehicles at certain times? Wars are infamous, yet you cannot hold the soldiers accountable who are merely defending their nations.\nPurchasing a vehicle costs hundreds of thousands, and covering various fees adds to this burden, which is already quite substantial for most families. It makes little sense and is unreasonable to levy an additional charge on drivers. Most families purchase cars primarily for safer and more convenient transportation, and adding excessive fees imposes a significant financial strain on them and infringes upon their rights.\nInstead of coercing drivers into paying another fee, the government should actively promote the use of efficient and eco-friendly energy sources or develop a more logical and accessible infrastructure that enables people to reach their destinations using less fuel. Traffic jams sometimes occur simply due to a malfunctioning traffic signal or poorly designed road systems. In such situations, the responsibility for a fine should lie with the city planner, not the drivers. Simply put, charging drivers fees without considering the root causes of the issues could be absurd and even illegal. \nIn conclusion, \"Rush hours\" are generally not a direct result of drivers' actions. Instead, the real causes of traffic congestion may stem from various factors, and therefore, imposing an additional fee on drivers for this could be unwarranted and unreasonable.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay318", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 398, "to": 446}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 490, "to": 600}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 602, "to": 704}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 716, "to": 780}], "label": "Claim", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 812, "to": 893}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 906, "to": 954}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1041, "to": 1143}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1145, "to": 1294}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1296, "to": 1377}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1379, "to": 1461}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1467, "to": 1567}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1569, "to": 1833}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1835, "to": 1941}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1963, "to": 2042}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2056, "to": 2160}], "label": "Claim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2178, "to": 2244}], "label": "Claim", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2339, "to": 2423}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 16}], "edges": [{"source": 3, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 3, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16]}

Personally, I align with the former perspective.\nThe immense advantages of English becoming a global standard are undeniable. To start, it becomes easier to communicate across nations and cultures. In my homeland, English is taught as a mandatory subject starting from elementary school. Hence, pursuing education abroad is more accessible and increasingly popular among young people. For these individuals, language barriers are eliminated, fostering mutual understanding and trust between one's home country and the host nation. This subsequently strengthens relationships and boosts international commerce. Additionally, scientists, particularly those in the high-tech sector, can access a broader range of resources if they are proficient in English. For instance, leading technical research in the IT sector is often released in English. Having access to translated versions of these works or a constant translator is not always feasible. Consequently, they are compelled to adopt English as a secondary language.\nAdmittedly, critics may argue that English contributes to the disappearance of lesser-known languages annually. Therefore, cultural heritage and national identity are being lost. However, this viewpoint is quite narrow, overlooking the swift progress of the native economy and society.\nIn conclusion, despite some adverse effects, I firmly believe that the widespread use of English benefits individuals and nations globally.

This is why it is crucial for individuals, particularly the youth, to develop the skills of planning and organizing, as these skills can boost efficiency and minimize the risks associated with our actions. At the same time, it can help eliminate unnecessary actions.\nTo begin with, having excellent planning and organizing skills can make actions more streamlined and productive. For example, For instance, I used to feel overwhelmed by the demands of preparing for final exams, submitting papers, and completing internship tasks at the end of each term. This year, however, I took my roommate John's advice and created a detailed to-do list, allowing me to perfectly plan and organize everything I needed to accomplish, thus gaining full control over my tasks. This ability to plan has greatly benefited me, enabling me to achieve top class rankings while successfully managing all other responsibilities.\nMoreover, the skill of planning and organizing also enables young people to address crises in their actions, preventing situations that could jeopardize long-term efforts. As commonly understood, employees in every organization are expected to maximize profits for their managers and deliver outstanding results in their assignments. if employees lack the ability to plan and organize their tasks in advance, they may procrastinate and only act when deadlines are looming. However, circumstances are always shifting. For example, sometimes, deadlines are moved up due to changes in the company's schedule. In such situations, those who fail to plan and complete their tasks ahead of time may end up missing deadlines, facing penalties, or even losing their jobs. No employee can afford such a setback.\nSome people argue that some believe that planning and organizing skills can be acquired only after entering the workforce. Therefore, there is no need for young individuals to possess these skills beforehand. Nonetheless, these skills are equally vital for young people, as with these skills, young individuals can overcome poor habits and achieve their goals more efficiently. while searching for information online, young people often get sidetracked by distractions like video games or social media. Under such conditions, they might spend hours aimlessly browsing the internet without accomplishing anything meaningful. this is undeniably a significant waste of time. However, by creating a plan upfront and sticking to it, they could complete their tasks far more efficiently than they'd originally expected.\nin this multifaceted society, young individuals are often surrounded by numerous responsibilities, and as such, the ability to plan and organize is unquestionably a vital and effective tool that everyone must acquire.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay270", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 136, "to": 239}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 244, "to": 328}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 406, "to": 502}], "label": "Claim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 517, "to": 677}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 679, "to": 884}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 886, "to": 1029}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1041, "to": 1201}], "label": "Claim", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1227, "to": 1363}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1365, "to": 1502}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1561, "to": 1635}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1657, "to": 1792}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1794, "to": 1831}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1856, "to": 1954}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1967, "to": 2040}], "label": "Claim", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2055, "to": 2102}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2107, "to": 2209}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2211, "to": 2334}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2359, "to": 2455}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2457, "to": 2503}], "label": "Premise", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2514, "to": 2645}], "label": "Premise", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2647, "to": 2744}], "label": "Claim", "id": 20}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2759, "to": 2863}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 21}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 13, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 13, "target": 14, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 13, "target": 19, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 14, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 19, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 19, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 19, "target": 18, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 6, 13, 20, 21]}

From my perspective, both rigorous studying and participating in sports are integral parts of children's lives. \nConversely, intensive studying will secure a brighter future for children. Diligent study equips children with abundant knowledge and skills for their future. As children mature and seek employment opportunities, for example, children who consistently study hard and achieve high grades find it easier to meet work qualifications and are more likely to secure positions at multinational companies. Working at a multinational company enables them to earn a higher salary. The takeaway is studying harder than others leads to achieving the best results.\nMeanwhile, participating in sports positively impacts children. Numerous sports are popular among children, including soccer, basketball, and volleyball. Additionally, engaging in sports offers numerous advantages for children. To begin with, children who frequently play sports like soccer become more active and learn teamwork skills. This benefits children, because they indirectly learn to socialize within a team setting.

Let's explore both perspectives in detail.\nOn one side, the immense advantages that professionals or students gain by connecting remotely are substantial. For instance, it enables professionals to achieve a better balance between work and personal life. A prime example is a new mother who can resume her job while also caring for her newborn. Moreover, Individuals also enjoy desired flexibility concerning their working hours. Additionally, For learners, studying from home presents an appealing alternative. They avoid commuting time to universities and can devote that time to their academic pursuits. In bustling cities like Tokyo, students spend significant time traveling. Hence, the benefits of working or studying from home are self-evident.\nConversely, a segment of society questions the efficiency of those who choose remote work or study. Many employers contend that working in isolation means that employees devote considerable time to communicating with colleagues through phone calls or emails. This negatively impacts an employee's output. Educators believe students are affected as they cannot immediately resolve their queries on study topics. Consequently, students fall behind in their academic pursuits.

Consequently, they face no disputes or disciplinary actions.\nMoreover, at this stage, they are free from the burden of responsibility.

{"id": "id_270", "input": "Focusing on health education and prevention instead of treatment is a thoroughly correct and exceptionally prudent policy. Once implemented, it will yield numerous advantages for both individuals and governmental bodies.\nHealth education leads to enduring positive impacts on future generations. Firstly, due to comprehensive health education from an early age, children develop beneficial habits for maintaining their health, which may persist into their teenage years. For instance, if a child learns to lead a hygienic lifestyle early on, they are likely to continue this practice as they grow older. Secondly, health education equips individuals, especially children, with vital knowledge to guard against disease risks. Instead of feeling fear or panic, they might remain calmer when faced with common illnesses like allergies or seasonal ailments. Many ailments that could be easily treated may become severe without proper intervention. Health education guides individuals in making informed treatment choices for quicker recovery.\nPreventive strategies contribute to the overall improvement of public health. For example, vaccinations ensure that expectant mothers and their infants are safeguarded against serious infections like influenza, smallpox, and rubella. When extensive vaccination drives are conducted nationwide, the general health of the community sees significant improvement. Since human resources are crucial to a nation's development, allocating funds to improve public health is a completely justified choice. Moreover, because the expenses associated with treatment often exceed those of preventive measures, this allows the government to conserve a substantial portion of the national health budget.\nIn conclusion, I am firmly convinced that greater emphasis should be placed on health education and preventive actions over medical treatment.

Favorable weather and a smaller population in a small town contribute significantly to good health. Additionally, small towns experience less congestion and reduced traffic. Living in areas with minimal pollution, like air or noise, enhances health, resulting in lower stress and increased happiness. Furthermore, foods and materials in small towns are often healthier compared to those in larger cities, with access to fresh produce.

Even more concerning is that some students misuse their phones as tools for cheating during exams by texting answers to each other. However, these problems can be addressed effectively with proper regulations and rules.\nAdditionally, it should be noted that certain health impacts can be extremely harmful. Research has shown that excessive use of electronic devices, including mobile phones, may increase the risk of hearing loss and even cancer, though further studies are necessary.\nTechnical concerns also present a contentious issue. There is a widespread fear that conversations might be eavesdropped on by third parties. This risk is ever-present. However, a more advanced and trustworthy system could be developed to protect users' private information.\nFurthermore, mobile phones have become indispensable, multifunctional tools in everyday life. They are not only used for communication but also serve as internet browsers, music players, personal organizers, and more.\nIn summary, excessive use of anything invariably results in negative consequences.

I strongly oppose such judgments based on appearance.\nFirstly, some individuals act deceptively, misleading others with their behavior, hence we must be cautious not to judge by appearances.

Nonetheless, I contend that television does more harm than good because it has led to a decline in interpersonal conversations.\nFirstly, television programs cause people to lose sight of what truly matters. Individuals with favorite shows tend to become engrossed when these shows are broadcast. Consequently, they avoid scheduling outings or gatherings with loved ones during those times since they perceive the shows to be vital to their existence.

This situation impacts not only our basketball plans but also our friendship, which thrives on frequent interactions. In essence, by choosing to watch TV alone, my friend missed a chance to strengthen our bond.\nFurthermore, even when watching TV together, meaningful conversation rarely occurs. Sharing a TV program is not much different from viewing it solo. Hence, watching TV is counterproductive to nurturing closeness. To exemplify, reports indicate that most people do not engage with their family while watching TV together. Their behavior is understandable because television programs demand no active involvement.\nIn summary, I strongly assert that sitting in front of the TV and just staring at it harms communication within groups, families, or friends.

Conversely, others argue for multiple shorter breaks throughout the year, allowing students to refresh themselves periodically. In either situation, students find ways to relieve stress. Nonetheless, I believe that frequent shorter breaks are beneficial in keeping students engaged and active in their studies.\nTo begin with, Having multiple vacations spread throughout the year can help reduce students' stress levels. Many educational institutions schedule short breaks after exams, providing students with much-needed relief from exam-related stress. On the other hand, Research conducted by universities indicates that regular breaks can enhance students' performance by offering respite from their academic routines. Numerous colleges abroad offer vacations after each semester, enabling students to relax and prepare for the next term. Furthermore, These breaks also help students gather resources such as books and reference materials for upcoming courses, while allowing time for enjoyment.\nAdditionally, scientific research offers credible surveys on student performance following breaks. It reveals that Students' ability to learn tends to improve after a refreshing vacation. For example, In my school, we were granted vacations following each quarterly exam. During these breaks, I would review my exam performance and revisit challenging questions or concepts to prevent future errors. I also dedicated time to developing hobbies and learning new sports or games. During each vacation, I found myself missing school, which fueled my eagerness to return with a strong drive to learn and excel in the new term.\nNot only students but also professionals and homemakers require breaks.

But have you ever considered the notion that television might be eroding communication among friends and family? I believe this is one of the detrimental impacts television has had on our lives.\nFirstly, due to excessive television viewing, individuals may become isolated from one another. Take children as an example; they often focus more on the movies and music shows offered by television, neglecting activities like attending school or exercising with friends, leading to social separation. Gradually, they find themselves left behind in both social activities and academics.\nSecondly, With the swift transformation of lifestyle standards, it is increasingly common for families to have three or four televisions in separate rooms. Instead of engaging with each other, parents and children prefer watching television in their own rooms. As a result, children absorb behaviors from television rather than learning them from their parents. Furthermore, parents fail to provide the essential parental guidance needed by their children. Consequently, interaction among family members is severely compromised.\nFinally, excessive television consumption can inadvertently teach harmful behaviors that breed division among people. For instance, viewing films centered on terrorism might lead children to perceive terrorism as justified. Could it be that mimicking the actions of terrorists depicted in Hollywood films is contributing to societal division?\nIn conclusion, despite television does have a positive side, it has significantly disrupted communication between friends and family.

Indeed, numerous tourists from across the globe were amazed by the seamless blend of modern technology with traditional culture.\nConversely, some individuals worry that technology might negatively impact traditional ways of living.

Nonetheless, since both genders hold equal significance, they should be granted the same opportunities. Universities should enroll an equal number of men and women, based on their preferences.\nThe right to education is a fundamental human right for both men and women. Globally, there is a focus on empowering women, and to realize this goal, women should be offered the same opportunities as men. By admitting equal numbers of both genders, universities will allow them to develop their skills and foster a healthy competitive atmosphere.\nCo-education facilitates better interaction between the genders. It teaches them how to collaborate, cooperate, and work together. For instance, students in all-boys schools often lack experience in interacting with females. Conversely, students in all-girls schools tend to be too shy to interact with boys. Co-education can help eliminate these shortcomings in both. By providing equal opportunities to both genders, universities prepare them for future challenges, benefiting them in the long term.\nRegrettably, some male chauvinists believe women are unable to succeed in specific areas like mathematics, mechanical engineering, and defense. This gender-biased perspective is harmful to societal progress. Repeatedly, women have consistently demonstrated their capabilities across all fields.

Therefore, numerous university administrations offer music classes to their students, allowing they coexist and study harmoniously with music. It seems to me that students, who dedicate much time to various academic subjects, should be able to manage the stress accumulated during school hours.

{"id": "id_290", "input": "From my perspective, it's not advisable for teenagers to have jobs while they're still in school. While some contend that it offers valuable work experience, I believe it can disrupt their lives in multiple ways. Working could negatively impact students' health. It distracts them from their studies and strips away the essential childhood phase of their life.\nIn today's competitive environment, students need to focus heavily on their studies to succeed. They must dedicate most of their time to school to achieve good grades. Engaging in a job during their remaining time adds unnecessary pressure on them. Additionally, Jobs come with various obligations like regular attendance and sometimes additional tasks. This could lead to stress, anxiety, and exhaustion. They might not have enough time to relax or get adequate sleep. Consequently, which could deteriorate their mental and physical health.\nAnother point is that Jobs can also distract students from their academic pursuits. If students begin earning money at a young age, they may become enamored with it. They might feel independent and choose to work more to earn money. This could compromise their education as they lose interest in their studies. Furthermore, They may even drop out to focus on earning more money.\nMoreover, A significant downside of teenage employment is missing out on the joys of childhood. They could miss out on activities like socializing with friends, club participation, and other enjoyable and social experiences. There is ample time for work and proving oneself later in life, but childhood is a fleeting phase that won't return. Hence, they should make the most of life while they can.\nThus, it's crucial for teenagers to focus on their studies.

{"id": "id_291", "input": "In today's world, closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras are extensively utilized in numerous settings, including schools, businesses, and other establishments, to observe ongoing activities. It's indisputable that CCTV offers a multitude of advantages, particularly in deterring criminal acts and safeguarding employees within a facility. However, some individuals contend that these cameras infringe upon their privacy due to constant surveillance. Despite this, I firmly maintain that CCTV cameras ought to be installed in every establishment to tackle the rising theft rates and to ensure the safety of workers at their workplace.\nTo begin with, installing CCTV cameras at workplaces can significantly reduce crimes like robbery. This is due to the fact that in the event of a theft, footage from CCTV cameras provides crucial evidence to track down the perpetrators. To elaborate, for instance, in Malaysia, law enforcement used CCTV footage to identify and apprehend a gang of robbers who targeted a Seven Eleven store at night. Additionally, employees, aware of being watched, are less inclined to commit theft. Consequently, it's evident that CCTV systems should be implemented in all workplaces to help curb crime rates.\nMoreover, in certain offices, staff frequently have to deal with irate or dissatisfied customers. Occasionally, interacting face-to-face with an irate customer may pose a physical threat to the employee. Therefore, CCTV installations can assist employees in avoiding such risky situations since because customers are aware that their interactions are being recorded. In cases of disputes, video recordings can clarify events and allow for appropriate measures to be taken. In essence, CCTV cameras can offer a layer of protection for workers against customer-related incidents.\nFrom an alternative viewpoint, the deployment of CCTV cameras does stir debate. Critics of CCTV surveillance argue that it violates their privacy by persistently monitoring them. Yet, it is important to acknowledge that security takes precedence over privacy, and it's better to prevent issues than to deal with their aftermath. Thus, detractors should strive to understand the rationale and focus on preventing themselves from becoming victims of crimes.\nIn summary, CCTV systems are crucial and should be installed in every establishment. The primary reason is to protect oneself from potential harm caused by intruders or thieves. It is acknowledged that these cameras do result in a loss of privacy.

In my opinion, even though protecting endangered species is crucial, the requirements of humans should take precedence.\nTo begin with, the global population is on a continuous rise, which means the demand for food among humans is growing proportionally. We require agricultural land to cultivate essential crops like wheat and corn, and it is undeniable that without a food supply, survival beyond a few weeks is impossible. Consequently, agricultural lands are essential for human survival.\nAdditionally, individuals need shelters to shield themselves from elements like wind, floods, and wild animals, so land is necessary for constructing homes. Housing is an undeniable basic necessity for humans, ranking just after food.\nLastly, humans require several essential items for survival, many of which are industrial, including medicines. As a result, some areas must be dedicated to industrial purposes. Modern life poses challenges that are alleviated through industrial advancements.\nIn summary, the number of endangered animals is far smaller than the human population, indicating that they require significantly less land compared to humans.

Personally, I believe opting for a career similar to one's parents can be advantageous for one's professional journey. \nTo begin with, because parents are familiar with the same professional environment, they can provide substantial assistance to their children, such as expertise and insights into the industry. For instance, my father is a software developer, and he has taught me a great deal about programming and computer science. I would consult him whenever I encountered challenges. Since having a wealth of experience, I am able to save significant time in finding solutions. This genuinely enhances my competitiveness compared to my peers. If I were in a different field than my father, I would encounter more challenges than I currently do.\nOn the other hand, because having worked for several decades, parents have developed an extensive network within a specific industry. They possess profound insights into the industry and can offer substantial support to their children.

{"id": "id_295", "input": "Participating in university lectures is an activity that students are expected to engage in. Nevertheless, class attendance is not the sole avenue for acquiring knowledge. Students can also gain insights through experiences, libraries, and interactions with others. I believe that students should have the option to choose whether to attend classes for the following reasons.\nFirstly, one reason university students should not be obligated to attend classes is university students can often learn more effectively from sources outside the classroom. Students have the opportunity to study independently in the library, focusing on the topics they find challenging. For example, I have a close friend who was in my department during our time at university. She had the ability to grasp all class material swiftly and effortlessly. Therefore, she seldom attended classes, preferring instead to concentrate on topics she found perplexing. Ultimately, she graduated with outstanding grades.\nSecondly, there should be no mandate for students to attend classes because students can allocate the time saved from not attending classes to other beneficial activities if they already have a solid understanding of the subject matter. Based on my personal experience, there were numerous instances when I skipped biology classes because my university didn't enforce attendance. Additionally, I had already covered all the biology topics prior to starting university.

The above example demonstrates that focusing on your strengths increases the likelihood of achieving your goals.\nContinuing to practice what you're good at leads to improvement. Excelling in an activity brings greater satisfaction and interest. Consequently, this self-motivation pushes you to do even more. To illustrate, During junior high, I was proficient in math.

However, some advocate for government-imposed limitations to curb their expressions. I, on the other hand, support this notion only to a limited degree and assert that artists should be granted freedom so they can create truly remarkable masterpieces.\nPrimarily, imposing control over artists' ideas will inevitably lead to a decline in their creativity over time. It is indisputable that when given the chance to express themselves, many artists will think innovatively and produce stunning works like paintings or films. Take for instance, the artworks of Da Vinci and Michelangelo are still admired today because they were not constrained during their era. In essence, with no limitations, artists will create more breathtaking pieces.\nMoreover, every individual has the right to express their opinions in various forms as long as it doesn't lead to societal issues. Currently, many nations strive to demonstrate their democratic nature. art is a medium that can be utilized to critique social issues and governmental policies within a country. To further elaborate, the renowned film '3 Idiots' starring Amir Khan critiques the education system that focuses on rote learning rather than practical application. Consequently, prohibiting artists from freely expressing their emotions infringes on human rights.\nExamining the situation from another angle, there are certain disadvantages if artists are left without restrictions. artists might delve into topics that can spark controversy within a nation. As an example, Malaysia is a multicultural country where citizens coexist in harmony and peace. if sensitive issues concerning races are highlighted in films or books, it could result in societal unrest. Nevertheless, I maintain that artists are well aware of their limits and would certainly avoid tarnishing their reputations through reckless behavior.\nIn conclusion, it is clear that artistic works should not be subjected to any restrictions. granting them the freedom to think will enable them to express themselves since ideas flow naturally when there are no constraints.

Additionally, effective communication is another crucial trait of a good roommate. \nConsideration is consistently essential in relationships. For instance, a roommate lowers the volume of music or television during nighttime. Occasionally, we remain unaware of our actions until we experience the consequences ourselves. Continuously considering the feelings of others before engaging in self-centered actions can greatly enhance roommate relations.

I am in full agreement that restrictions should be applied to adolescents' exposure because adolescents lack the maturity to avoid being misled by these themes; however, when adults are the audience, there's really nothing to conceal \u2013 these negative aspects are an objective part of reality, and it is implausible for adults to be brainwashed by mere creative art.\nIn conclusion, I do not support the notion of imposing restrictions on artists' work; rather, they should be motivated to share their innovative concepts \u2013 the world relies on them to add vibrancy.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay067", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 243, "to": 362}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 364, "to": 508}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 535, "to": 631}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 661, "to": 852}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 854, "to": 990}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1192, "to": 1241}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1318, "to": 1406}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1436, "to": 1491}], "label": "Claim", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1500, "to": 1567}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1578, "to": 1772}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1868, "to": 1927}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1930, "to": 1970}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 1, "target": 3, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 1, "target": 5, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 7, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 7, 10, 11]}
{"id": "id_303", "input": "When choosing a place to live, public services and the nearby environment are often the critical aspects that influence our decision. Nonetheless, it can be challenging to find a community that perfectly aligns with all our requirements. In my hometown, most public utilities are well-established apart from transportation. Therefore, what I truly wish to alter is the availability of more public transportation options. This is particularly pertinent because I encounter traffic congestion daily. Moreover, this issue appears to be worsening. \nInitially, there should be more alternatives for public transportation, like a subway or a sky train. Consequently, individuals will have various options for reaching their destinations. Given that currently, buses are the sole form of public transit available in this community, It leaves residents with no alternatives. They are compelled to rely solely on buses to travel to other locations. Introducing a subway and sky train would significantly enhance convenience for them. For instance, individuals can predict travel time when using a subway train thanks to the timetable. In contrast, this isn't possible with buses. Additionally, this enhancement will indirectly alleviate road traffic issues. \nSecondly, the buses in this area only offer two routes. This is undoubtedly a significant concern. To illustrate, if my destination isn't on a bus route, I must first travel to a central station to switch buses, which doesn't directly take me to my intended location. Clearly, this process is time-consuming. More routes should be added to facilitate easier transportation for residents.\nFinally, expanding public transportation options can reduce the number of people driving their own cars. It also offers numerous benefits. For example, individuals can cut down on fuel expenses, which have become increasingly costly. Essential energy resources will be conserved over time, as people will rely less on their personal vehicles.\nIn conclusion, transportation is a fundamental aspect that significantly impacts people's daily lives. I hope that one day this issue will be addressed, making transportation in my hometown hassle-free for everyone in the community.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay288", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 335, "to": 419}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 460, "to": 496}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 556, "to": 645}], "label": "Claim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 661, "to": 730}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 743, "to": 823}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 825, "to": 865}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 867, "to": 938}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 940, "to": 1023}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1039, "to": 1124}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1126, "to": 1169}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1185, "to": 1247}], "label": "Claim", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1260, "to": 1304}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1306, "to": 1347}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1364, "to": 1516}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1527, "to": 1557}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1559, "to": 1636}], "label": "Claim", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1647, "to": 1741}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1790, "to": 1870}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1872, "to": 1926}], "label": "Claim", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1931, "to": 1979}], "label": "Premise", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1996, "to": 2082}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 20}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 19, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 10, 15, 18, 20]}

This trend is evident not only among affluent students but also among those from less privileged backgrounds. Many students opt for a one or two-year hiatus, during which some travel extensively, while others choose to work.\nThe knowledge and insights gained from traveling to various locations, interacting with diverse individuals, or through employment prove invaluable. Such experiences not only boost a student's self-assurance but also foster independence. Students who work during this time often accumulate better financial means, which can be beneficial during their university years. This period helps them gain clarity about their life aspirations. They develop a wider perspective, enabling them to make more informed choices regarding their future academic paths.\nTaking a break is not solely advantageous, as it may also lead to certain drawbacks. Once students begin earning, they might be reluctant to return to an academic setting where they sacrifice their financial autonomy. They could struggle to readjust to the educational environment. There is the potential risk that some students may never resume their university or advanced education. Some might opt for short-term courses over comprehensive university education, aiming for better employment opportunities and salaries. However, this approach may provide only temporary benefits, as it is widely recognized that a substantial career in the long term requires proper and advanced qualifications.\nFrom my perspective, I am inclined to support the notion of taking a gap year prior to commencing higher education.

Nevertheless, some employers maintain that academic qualifications should remain the primary criterion. This essay aims to delve into both perspectives and also convey my personal viewpoint.\nTo begin with, there are those who argue that qualifications should be the primary standard for evaluating an employee's worth. It's crucial for workers to be highly educated and have proper training to fulfill their job responsibilities. In particular, individuals in specialized professions like medicine are obligated to hold a university degree and have extensive experience. Furthermore, Social skills appear to be less significant as they do not directly contribute to the success of a surgical operation.\nConversely, there is no denying that the value of social skills is increasingly acknowledged by many employers. This is due to the fact that today's workforce is often required to collaborate in teams. Interpersonal skills are vital for fostering cooperation among colleagues, especially during conflicts. Enhanced social skills enable individuals to resolve disputes more amicably. Additionally, organizations have shifted towards a customer-centric approach. Strong social skills assist employees in building robust relationships with clients, leading to improved customer satisfaction.\nFrom my perspective, I tend to assert that qualifications remain the primary indicator of an employee's capability to perform their job.

{"id": "id_306", "input": "Lately, considerable focus has been directed towards modes of transportation. Some argue that cars are the most convenient option, while others believe that alternative transport methods should be considered due to environmental concerns. Personally, I firmly believe that introducing alternative transportation methods and international regulations for controlling cars is essential. This essay will thoroughly explore the reasons in the following sections.\nTo begin with, the rise in the number of cars leads to environmental degradation. Given that car emissions, including carbon dioxide, have detrimental effects on air quality, air pollution results in respiratory illnesses among local residents. Consequently, it is vital to shift from cars to other transportation means and enact laws to regulate car usage.\nMoreover, the surge in vehicles contributes to severe traffic jams. being stuck in traffic squanders our time. Even more concerning, traffic delays frustrate drivers, leading to more traffic accidents. Hence, strategies to decrease car numbers and regulate car ownership and usage should be swiftly devised and put into action.\nTo address these challenges, alternative transportation and international regulations on car ownership and use can be effective solutions. Regarding the first issue, alternatives with lower emissions than cars are preferable. For instance, a bike rental system has been set up in several European nations. This system allows individuals to rent bicycles at district corners for a small fee and travel to other districts. Since bicycles do not emit carbon dioxide or harmful gases, they represent a more environmentally friendly option than cars. Concerning the second matter, enacting international laws can also be beneficial. For example, certain regulations restrict car usage to specific times and limit individuals to owning just one car. Consequently, such measures can alleviate both traffic and environmental issues.\nTo conclude, despite the fact that some people advocate for the convenience of cars, I assert that alternative transportation and international car control laws are essential for environmental conservation and easing traffic issues.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay031", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 273, "to": 383}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 474, "to": 539}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 552, "to": 632}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 634, "to": 702}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 718, "to": 815}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 827, "to": 883}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 885, "to": 926}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 950, "to": 1017}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1026, "to": 1143}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1174, "to": 1282}], "label": "Claim", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1311, "to": 1369}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1385, "to": 1449}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1451, "to": 1564}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1572, "to": 1624}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1626, "to": 1689}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1721, "to": 1771}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1786, "to": 1887}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1903, "to": 1968}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2005, "to": 2053}], "label": "Claim", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2069, "to": 2201}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 19}], "edges": [{"source": 3, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 4, 8, 9, 18, 19]}
{"id": "id_307", "input": "Today, we're navigating a world that is undeniably complex. Everything seems to move at a fast pace, and there's a significant amount of competition. These factors contribute to stress among individuals. Hence, many people seek ways to alleviate their stress. Numerous activities can help those who are stressed. Personally, engaging in activities like listening to music, playing sports, and practicing meditation are straightforward and effective methods to reduce stress.\nTo begin with, listening to music serves as an excellent method to unwind. For instance, when I head to work, I rely on public transportation. I encounter various situations like traffic congestion, crowds at bus stops, and packed buses. These scenarios elevate my stress levels. Therefore, I habitually listen to music using my MP3 player. I can enjoy music without being concerned about my surroundings. As a result, Music brings me joy and happiness.\nAnother point is that exercise is another highly effective way for everyone to alleviate stress. For example, I often have a lot on my mind, such as challenging tasks that need to be completed promptly. These issues sometimes make it difficult for me to fall asleep as they increase my stress. Therefore, after work, I make it a point to exercise, with jogging being my preferred activity. I find that working out makes it easier for me to fall asleep. Exercise not only helps reduce my stress but also enhances my overall health.\nAdditionally, meditation is also a viable method for stress reduction. When I'm burdened with numerous thoughts, leading to stress, I turn to meditation. Meditation provides a simple way to unwind because it doesn't require any equipment and takes only a few minutes. A meditation technique I use involves sitting down, closing my eyes, and focusing on my breathing. These practices help alleviate my stress. \nIn summary, there are various methods to alleviate stress.

{"id": "id_308", "input": "There have been numerous occasions where luck has granted people unimaginable opportunities. Nonetheless, I find no logical reason to rely on luck for achieving goals. Thus, I am firmly convinced that it is through diligent effort that one attains their objectives.\nTo begin with, relying solely on luck for your accomplishments involves taking a significant gamble. Luck is an elusive concept, and there is no assurance it will ever favor you. If luck fails, it can lead to considerable disappointment. On the other hand, if you put in the effort to achieve your desires, your hard work will at least bring you closer to your goal. From my own experience, every achievement I've had was a result of my hard work, not chance. Moreover, I have never faced the disappointment of falling short of my goals.\nFurthermore, if you hold the belief that dedication and effort lead to success, you are likely to be a visionary individual. In essence, individuals who trust in hard work have a clear vision of their objectives and understand their ultimate destination. They meticulously plan the journey to achieve their goals and continuously assess their progress until they succeed. Believing in luck leaves you uncertain about your direction. For instance, a friend of mine, facing severe financial difficulties, consistently bought lottery tickets in hopes of winning someday. He was trapped in the illusion that a lottery win would resolve his financial problems. Yet, to this day, luck has not favored him, and his troubles have worsened.\nAdditionally, through hard work, luck may also favor you, propelling you beyond your intended goals. For instance, my boss put in relentless effort to earn a promotion. He examined every requirement needed for the promotion. He realized that acquiring a master's degree would be a valuable asset to outshine his peers.

In the past, finding a tutor to learn a foreign language was challenging. However, with globalization, finding a language teacher locally has become much easier. For instance, in the Indian subcontinent, numerous institutes have emerged offering training in various languages such as French, German, and others.\nSecondly, foreign language courses are now part of the curriculum in colleges and universities. students have the liberty to select from a range of languages offered by their university. Thus, learning a foreign language domestically has become quite convenient. Additionally, highly skilled foreign language educators are readily available in many educational institutions.\nThirdly, technology has significantly bridged the gap when it comes to learning a foreign language at home. numerous online courses and discussion forums exist for foreign language learners.\nIn conclusion, it is more beneficial for individuals to acquire a foreign language in their own country. it is more affordable and there are abundant opportunities available to achieve this.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay299", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 306, "to": 396}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 497, "to": 569}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 574, "to": 648}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 650, "to": 722}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 733, "to": 810}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 826, "to": 960}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 972, "to": 1056}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1058, "to": 1147}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1155, "to": 1223}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1239, "to": 1335}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1346, "to": 1443}], "label": "Claim", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1445, "to": 1526}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1543, "to": 1631}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1633, "to": 1717}], "label": "Claim", "id": 13}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 4, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 4, 8, 10, 12, 13]}

Many believe that these elements are primarily gained through academic learning. I do agree with this view to some extent. However, I believe that individuals can also thrive without attending universities.\nFirstly, it's undeniable that a university education holds significant importance for professions like doctors, engineers, and lawyers. Without the necessary training and knowledge, excelling in these careers would be unattainable. Moreover, while at university, students have the chance to share knowledge and network with potential business partners. This networking can be advantageous when they decide to launch their own firms or medical practices.\nFrom a different angle, there is also a notable number of individuals who have achieved great success without attending university. Consider those who embark on entrepreneurial ventures. These entrepreneurs rely solely on determination and fortune. Interestingly, for some, it turned out to be a lucrative endeavor. For example, Michael Dell, the founder and CEO of Dell, left college at the age of 19. Initially, He began his computer enterprise right in his college dormitory. Eventually, He utilized both his earnings and a family loan to evolve into the successful person he is now.\nMoreover, Those with innate abilities are also likely to succeed. This is particularly evident in fields like entertainment and sports. The rise in reality TV shows has provided a platform for the fortunate to succeed.

Firstly, computers require human operation. It is indisputable that technological tools are essential in today's classrooms. For instance, lessons become more engaging and understandable when presented via PowerPoint and displayed using an LCD projector. However, scientific research indicates that every classroom needs skilled personnel to utilize these interactive and advanced teaching methods.

Regardless of technological advancements, it's evident that a computer will never engage in true communication with its students. A recent interview with Josh Trumm, the founder of 'Teachers Global Group', emphasizes that human interactions cannot be replicated by computers: 'This verbal and non-verbal communication between educators and students is a fundamental step towards effective educationn.

It is my conviction that reducing the number of patients within the healthcare system enables hospitals and medical centers to operate more efficiently, leading to improved care for existing patients.

Telephones and email foster a sense of closeness with my parents.\nSecondly, telephones and email can sometimes convey important messages more effectively than face-to-face interactions. For example, Occasionally, during disagreements with friends, I struggle to articulate my thoughts at that moment. Therefore, Once I have time to reflect, I can communicate my true intentions calmly. Hence, these communication methods make me feel connected on a personal level.\nTelephones and email provide me with a personal connection because I can directly reach out to the people I care about.

{"id": "id_317", "input": "In today's world, the gap between educational institutions and society continues to widen. To help students adapt more swiftly to societal norms, it would be beneficial for parents to motivate them to engage in part-time work. Here are some reasons supporting my perspective.\nFirstly, opportunities for students to learn about adult life at university are limited. This is because the majority of individuals they interact with are fellow students. On the other hand, through part-time employment, students interact with a diverse range of people, predominantly adults. Consequently, these adults can impart valuable lessons about living as a grown-up. My friend Lisa, who currently holds a part-time job, describes the experience as wonderful. Her part-time job has allowed her to form friendships with various individuals, exposing her to different facets of adult life. For instance, Initially, Lisa believed work was central to adult life, but after meeting her new friends, she realized responsibility is the true core, not work. As a result, with the insights from her new acquaintances, she now feels more confident about her future adult life. \nSecondly, parents often emphasize that adult life is significantly more stressful than school life. Nonetheless, since we haven't experienced it firsthand, it's challenging for us to truly grasp how stressful adulthood can be. Consequently, part-time work is necessary to teach us the challenges of adult life. In fact, surveys suggest that students who engage in part-time work tend to make the most of their time preparing for the future and have more realistic expectations than those who don't. Hence, part-time work can provide a clearer understanding of future life.\nThirdly, some parents worry that part-time jobs might negatively impact students' academic performance. In reality, the majority of students opt to work part-time during their holidays, so this schedule prevents any adverse effects on their studies. Compared to spending holidays playing computer games, part-time jobs are a more constructive use of time for students.\nIn summary, engaging in part-time work allows students to truly experience adult life and gain deeper insights into it. Thus, parents should advocate for students to pursue part-time employment.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay319", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 146, "to": 225}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 285, "to": 363}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 381, "to": 447}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 468, "to": 568}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 584, "to": 651}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 653, "to": 743}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 745, "to": 871}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 887, "to": 1033}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1048, "to": 1150}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1163, "to": 1251}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1272, "to": 1307}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1309, "to": 1378}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1394, "to": 1462}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1473, "to": 1650}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1659, "to": 1724}], "label": "Claim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1759, "to": 1828}], "label": "Claim", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1842, "to": 1910}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1915, "to": 1974}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1976, "to": 2093}], "label": "Premise", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2107, "to": 2213}], "label": "Claim", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2221, "to": 2288}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 20}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 17, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 17, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 17, "target": 18, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 4, 12, 14, 15, 19, 20]}
{"id": "id_318", "input": "In today's world, the decision to construct large factories near residential zones has sparked significant debate. Although industrial structures are essential for contemporary economic progress, many individuals oppose the idea due to pollution concerns. Personally, if we address the environmental challenges posed by factories, the benefits of establishing a factory will surpass its drawbacks.\nTo begin with, a large factory can drive local economic development and decrease unemployment rates. The production of goods necessitates a workforce, providing employment opportunities for local inhabitants. Additionally, a factory is not an isolated entity; it will attract other industries and businesses, fostering regional economic growth. For instance, the real estate sector will expand to meet the housing needs of the workforce.\nThe primary drawback is pollution. Many regions are experiencing severe consequences from excessive industrial development, including water pollution, traffic congestion, and health issues. For example, in various industrial cities, a significant number of workers suffer from respiratory conditions like asthma, which can result from exposure to waste ashes and certain chemicals.\nNevertheless, as society progresses, the construction of more factories is unavoidable. Hence, focusing on mitigating the downsides of factory construction is more crucial than debating the necessity of building them. Indeed, most issues can be prevented if factories genuinely commit to effective waste management.\nIn summary, setting up manufacturing facilities is part of the industrialization trend for numerous nations.

{"id": "id_319", "input": "Examinations remain one of the most prevalent tools for evaluating learning within education systems globally. At nearly every phase of education, they are employed to confirm whether a learner is prepared to advance to the next level. Nonetheless, there is growing debate about whether the function of exams should be reevaluated.\nExaminations undeniably offer certain benefits. They promote equity by subjecting all candidates to identical conditions. Exams are also fairly adaptable; for instance, multiple-choice questions and essay-based tasks can evaluate various forms of reasoning and understanding. On the other hand, there are also significant disadvantages associated with exams. Candidates who are adept at test-taking can often perform well despite lacking substantial knowledge or skills. Additionally, some individuals fail to perform to their potential due to exam-related stress or anxiety. Furthermore, educators and students may narrow their focus to only those elements of the curriculum that are likely to appear on exams, thus limiting the breadth of educational experiences.\nIt is essential to implement measures to address these issues. Ideally, exams should align closely with the content and practices of the learning environment. Exam formats should be diversified to ensure fairness by accommodating candidates with varying skill sets. Alternative assessment methods, such as written assignments for evaluating independent learning and research, or group projects for assessing teamwork skills, should also be explored.\nIn summary, it is evident that exams play a crucial role in providing an objective and reliable measure of student achievement.

{"id": "id_320", "input": "Crime must always be met with consequences. Retribution serves as a tool to counter criminal actions. Different nations have varying degrees of strictness in their legal systems, with some implementing capital punishment, while others offer a more flexible approach. Nonetheless, stringent laws, such as capital punishment, are crucial for maintaining order in society.\nCapital punishment is reserved for the most extreme and rare cases. Its primary goal is to ensure the safety of other individuals. When a criminal poses a significant threat to society and is capable of committing grievous crimes, they are sentenced to capital punishment. Consequently, capital punishment serves to shield society from dangerous criminals.\nFurthermore, capital punishment deters the motivation and potential for other serious crimes. If a criminal understands the severity of the penalty, they are likely to refrain from committing such offenses. Therefore, this leads to a significant reduction in crime and violence rates.\nSignificantly, capital punishment reduces the government's expenses that would otherwise be spent on maintaining these dangerous criminals. Thus, those criminals who show no potential for rehabilitation or have a history of such offenses are sentenced to capital punishment.\nHowever, the jury responsible for delivering the verdict are human too. They hold the power over an individual's life. Mistakes can occur, which may unjustly affect individuals who are innocent or whose circumstances led to their criminal actions. Therefore, the jury must thoroughly consider the context in which the crime was committed. For instance, for instance, if someone kills in self-defense, that act isn't considered a heinous crime. Capital punishment is reserved for those who commit atrocious acts with full awareness and intent.\nCapital punishment is vital for curbing violence in society.

Predicting the conclusion becomes easy if good characters consistently triumph. Consequently, our interest wanes. However, if good characters aren't always victorious, we're motivated to watch until the end to uncover the resolution. For instance, Typically, Hollywood narratives end on a high note, with heroes defeating villains and winning romantic interests. But many, myself included, have grown weary of this pattern.

Hence, We should inform young children about this to prevent misconceptions.\nIndeed, Occasionally, happy endings serve a beneficial purpose. Some individuals might be motivated to act kindly. But as I mentioned earlier, Such behavior is unlikely to endure, because Eventually, they will come to understand the reality. Thus, I propose narratives should convey the truth.

While some advocate for fostering a competitive spirit in children, others emphasize the importance of nurturing cooperation.

This trait is initially cultivated in schools, where educators motivate students to embrace competitiveness through the grading system, pushing them to excel by achieving the highest scores. This attribute will pave the way for their future success, but it can also limit them in various ways.

Additionally, students can assist each other in better understanding the material. Conversely, not attending classes deprives them of the opportunity to receive help from others in tackling challenging issues.\nOne more essential aspect to consider is that teachers assist students in grasping concepts more swiftly and effortlessly, because instructors provide thorough explanations in class, followed by numerous examples to elucidate the concepts.

{"id": "id_328", "input": "What crosses your mind when you observe a stunning building? Or when you see an airport? Do you believe they were constructed by mere chance? Obviously not. It's equally absurd to think that global networks like Google or Yahoo emerged by accident. While some individuals attribute success to sheer luck, I must respectfully disagree with them. Allow me to delve into my main arguments here.\nTo start, well-known individuals are typically hardworking rather than merely lucky. Diligence transforms you into an expert in your profession, empowering you in your career. To put it simply, by putting in effort, you minimize the role of luck in achieving success. Take, for instance, in soccer, it's often said that scoring a goal from a penalty kick requires a bit of luck. Statistically, the probability of converting a penalty kick into a goal is fifty-fifty. However, I believe Ronaldo has a higher likelihood of scoring from a penalty kick than I do. This isn't because Ronaldo is luckier than I am. It's undoubtedly due to his extensive practice and training. He engages in rigorous training on the football field daily, thus it isn't that he's more fortunate than me.\nFurthermore, we cannot consistently rely on luck to achieve success. While I don't dismiss the influence of luck in success, its presence is rather infrequent. For example, Consider preparing for the TOEFL or similar multiple-choice exams, where each question offers four choices. It's impossible to approach such exams without preparation and solely depend on luck, even if you are exceptionally fortunate. Randomly selecting answers will lead to failure in the exam.

{"id": "id_329", "input": "In our daily interactions, we meet various individuals and receive diverse opinions about ourselves or our work, whether they are favorable or unfavorable. While compliments are easy to accept, criticism can be challenging. Hence, the idea is that individuals who cannot accept criticism from others cannot thrive in collaborative environments. Personally, I concur with this viewpoint.\nTo begin with, the foundation of teamwork is achieving \"consensus\". It means valuing everyone's input. In collaborative projects, team members come together for brainstorming sessions, evaluate all potential solutions, and ultimately reach a mutual agreement. During these extensive discussions, differing opinions are bound to emerge. If one member stubbornly clings to their idea and ignores criticism from others, it won't be effective because the project is a collective effort, not a solo performance for one particular member. It is everyone's responsibility to honor each other's viewpoints.\nSecondly, embracing criticism is commendable as it involves considering opposing views. Even outside of teamwork, taking criticism remains necessary. Criticism undeniably stings because it highlights your weaknesses and compels you to address them. Yet, criticism can assist you in identifying and correcting those flaws if you're open to it. Those who refuse to accept any criticism will eventually miss opportunities for self-improvement. Put differently, if you reject all criticism, you'll struggle not just in collaboration but also in individual endeavors. As a Chinese proverb states, \"Effective medicine often has a bitter taste\". Criticism might be the most potent remedy for personal growth.\nNonetheless, some might wonder: what if the critique turns out to be incorrect? What if I was initially right but the seemingly plausible criticism led me astray? Isn't persistence also a commendable trait? From my perspective, even when you're correct, criticism can still be beneficial because in such instances, it functions not only as a corrective tool but also as a means to assess your understanding of your work. Accepting criticism doesn't necessarily imply accepting it in entirety. You should also apply your own discernment! And mastering the art of utilizing criticism effectively is a skill.\nIn summary, criticism is vital, especially in teamwork, but it remains necessary in other contexts as well. It's akin to a discerning mirror that allows us to see our flaws and strive to become better and more self-assured.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay251", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 248, "to": 343}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 402, "to": 453}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 455, "to": 488}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 490, "to": 645}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 723, "to": 825}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 834, "to": 918}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 920, "to": 984}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 996, "to": 1072}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1074, "to": 1134}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1136, "to": 1163}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1172, "to": 1233}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1240, "to": 1327}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1329, "to": 1425}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1444, "to": 1547}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1549, "to": 1623}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1625, "to": 1686}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1916, "to": 1975}], "label": "Claim", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1984, "to": 2107}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2109, "to": 2179}], "label": "Premise", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2181, "to": 2223}], "label": "Premise", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2225, "to": 2292}], "label": "Premise", "id": 20}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2306, "to": 2400}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 21}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 8, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 11, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 16, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 16, "target": 18, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 16, "target": 19, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 16, "target": 20, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 8, 16, 21]}

For example, during football matches, students from different high schools will come together and maintain contact after the events. This will enhance the students' social networks. The only downside is the noise generated during competitions.

{"id": "id_331", "input": "The aim of education is a frequently debated issue among individuals and society, especially at advanced levels like college or university. While some argue that every student should have the opportunity to pursue education at these levels, I believe that it is more beneficial to reserve this level of education for a select group of capable and knowledgeable learners.\nTo begin with, prioritizing talented students is a more effective approach because it assists academic institutions in preserving their high standards of education. Unlike secondary education, higher education demands significant abilities and skills to manage a vast array of complex knowledge. Indeed, some students may excel in high school, yet the demands of higher education can be challenging even for the gifted. This is why it suits only a select few, and opening it up to everyone could be detrimental to the institutions, as they would need to simplify the curriculum to accommodate all.\nAdditionally, universities should admit only adept students since it provides superior human resources for complex tasks. Although some contend that this might cause 'social stratification', where individuals with higher education avoid so-called 'lower-tier jobs', in reality, it poses no threat to society as a whole. Standard roles will remain accessible to all, whereas complex positions should be reserved for the elite, who commence their careers at top institutions. I am convinced that restricting university admissions is a wise decision because it encourages student motivation and consistently challenges them, leading to self-improvement. Ultimately, this enhances educational quality overall and provides society with highly skilled individuals for critical roles.\nIn conclusion, I support that mandatory education should extend to high school, but higher education should be reserved for the top students.

Additionally, the escalation of sea levels, driven by global warming, poses a significant risk to human life across numerous nations.

It may hold true that advertising sways people into buying items that are not essential for their lives. For instance, in many Asian nations, advertising companies often employ famous singers or actors to promote their products, boosting sales as some individuals, particularly teenagers, purchase items endorsed by their favorite celebrities to support them rather than out of necessity.\nMoreover, advertisements typically present products as more appealing and of higher quality, leading people to make impulsive purchases without much thought. An effective advertisement can persuade individuals that a product is something they desire, even if it doesn't fulfill a genuine need within society. Additionally, many people buy specific products influenced by advertisements, creating a trend that others follow even when they do not truly need it.\nOn the contrary, purchasing habits are highly personal to each individual, advertising is not the sole reason people make purchases, at times, it depends on personal needs and spending capacity. adults are less likely to make impulsive purchases as they are concerned with managing their disposable income. most adults need to budget their money if they are making other purchases. Conversely, children and teenagers, who aren't financially independent, are more prone to impulsively purchase items without considering their necessity, because they lack financial responsibilities and the ability to discern what is necessary.\nPersonally, I believe people's purchasing habits are a matter of personal choice and not completely dictated by advertisements. However, for children and teenagers who are not yet mentally mature, it can be challenging to resist the influence of advertising. Therefore, it is crucial for the government to enforce regulations on specific advertising companies (such as those selling toys) to prevent young people from developing misconceptions about what they truly need.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay347", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 171, "to": 252}], "label": "Claim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 268, "to": 536}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 548, "to": 694}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 696, "to": 845}], "label": "Claim", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 861, "to": 996}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1015, "to": 1071}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1073, "to": 1129}], "label": "Claim", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1131, "to": 1191}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1193, "to": 1303}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1305, "to": 1378}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1392, "to": 1532}], "label": "Claim", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1542, "to": 1623}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1647, "to": 1751}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1762, "to": 1882}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1895, "to": 2095}], "label": "Claim", "id": 14}], "edges": [{"source": 0, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 3, 6, 10, 12, 14]}

Hence, some argue that younger students need not delve into other subjects. However, from my perspective, art and music are equally vital for the future lives of younger students because these subjects offer students a different viewpoint of the world and provide a means to alleviate the intense pressures of modern life. In this scenario, I firmly believe that art and music should be mandatory subjects for study.\nTo begin with, art and music have the potential to expand students' horizons and encourage deep thinking. It is widely recognized that art and music transcend national boundaries, serving as universal symbols of diverse cultures. In such situations, by learning art and music, students can appreciate the works of renowned artists and musicians and experience the allure of various cultures. For example, students can immerse themselves in Europe's greatest musical masterpieces, such as Beethoven's iconic Symphony of Fate. \nMoreover, engaging with art and music provides excellent avenues for stress relief and relaxation. Clearly, as life's pace accelerates, people are increasingly overwhelmed by academic or professional pressures, which can be destructive if not managed properly. Art and music are among the most accessible means for modern individuals to escape the high-pressure demands of life. Viewing a masterpiece like the Mona Lisa allows people to momentarily set aside their worries to ponder the meaning behind its enigmatic smile. At this point, they become fully immersed in the world of art, and their tension and anxiety are eased. Evidently, this appreciation for art is grounded in early education in the arts.\nIt's true that the pursuit of art and music should ideally align with the personal interests of young students. Art and music education cannot succeed if students are unwilling to engage. Therefore, schools should consider substituting some basic science classes with art and music classes to foster an interest in art without increasing academic stress.\nIn summary, in today's society, comprehending the complexities of the world is crucial, all while individuals face overwhelming pressures, art and music education for younger students should not be sidelined.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay261", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 263, "to": 356}], "label": "Claim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 365, "to": 499}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 541, "to": 593}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 610, "to": 699}], "label": "Claim", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 701, "to": 823}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 845, "to": 985}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1000, "to": 1118}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1131, "to": 1218}], "label": "Claim", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1229, "to": 1380}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1382, "to": 1498}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1500, "to": 1642}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1659, "to": 1746}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1759, "to": 1827}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1844, "to": 1939}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1941, "to": 2015}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2028, "to": 2182}], "label": "Claim", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2196, "to": 2321}], "label": "Claim", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2323, "to": 2391}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 17}], "edges": [{"source": 0, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 2, 3, 7, 15, 16, 17]}

In my opinion, putting aside a portion of your earnings is crucial because the future is unpredictable in both professional and personal realms, and savings allow you to achieve some of your aspirations.\nFirstly, there are numerous uncertainties concerning your career path. The current global economic situation is challenging, with many unpredictable elements necessitating some financial reserves. For instance, I recall friends who recently faced job losses because of the European economic crisis. A few of them lacked personal savings. They were unable to cover their rent, which led to resulting in them moving back with their families, losing their independence.\nMoreover, personal life developments are equally unpredictable. Unexpected expenses may arise in the future, which you might struggle to meet without savings. During my university days, a friend had minimal savings and faced a significant car repair. He couldn't manage the repair costs, and as a result, forcing him to sell the vehicle. \nLastly, savings enable you to purchase luxury items and realize your dreams. Saving diligently for future investments offers a sense of accomplishment and allows you to reward yourself for your efforts.

{"id": "id_339", "input": "While some individuals argue that the majority of the school timetable should focus solely on academics, I firmly hold that the significance of physical education should not be underestimated. Engaging in physical activities not only fosters a healthier population but also enhances learning through experiential observation and contributes to the economic growth of a nation. \nTo begin with, an old Latin saying goes: \"Anima sana in corpore sano,\" signifying that a sound body forms the foundation of a sound mind. There exists a direct correlation between an individual's health and the regularity of their physical exercise. The more we engage in physical activities, the better our overall well-being becomes. Additionally, It is evident that daily physical activity can enhance health: progressively, we improve our physical condition. Consequently, if people start participating in sports from a young age and incorporate it into their daily routine, it can ultimately help in building a healthier nation.\nMoreover, engaging in both outdoor and indoor sports clarifies numerous aspects. For instance, regular jogging helps individuals understand their bodies better through direct observation. Similarly, a school basketball team learns more about successfully executing specific throws by practicing rather than solely through theory. Furthermore, nearly all breakthroughs in natural sciences were achieved through direct observation, which ties back to physical education. \nLastly, but certainly not least, a region's economic stability is largely contingent upon the health of its inhabitants. For example, investing in physical education programs can reduce healthcare costs, since the population is relatively healthy. Alongside, individuals with good physical health can contribute more significantly to both economic and social progress. Indeed, as a person's physical well-being improves, so does their cognitive function. Therefore, emphasizing physical activities early in life can lead to a mentally healthier society.

{"id": "id_341", "input": "Tourism, since its inception long ago, can be likened to a contentious celebrity. Some argue that tourism leads to domestic economic disruption, environmental degradation, and irreparable harm to the places it exploits. Nevertheless, I firmly refute this misconception for two main reasons.\nFirstly, tourism is vital for fostering the economy as it is intended to. Essentially, tourist attractions are often situated in remote areas where the economy had not flourished prior to their development. It is only with the investment from certain companies that networks of hotels and services begin to emerge. This inevitably draws significant attention, accompanied by substantial income for local inhabitants. In other words, tourism helps steer the local economy in the right direction, maximizing its inherent potential.\nSecondly, although environmental harm is unavoidable, tourism should not be held accountable for it. To transform a wilderness into an attractive site, planners must thoroughly consider the care of the landscapes. Specifically, for example, a substantial amount is invested in pruning trees, watering flowers, conserving and maintaining the balance of local wildlife and plants, all in the effort to enhance the natural beauty.

Research indicates that with the yearly rise in childhood obesity rates, incorporating regular physical activity provides a valuable respite from prolonged periods of sitting in school. Additionally, regular exercise reduces the risk of illnesses related to cardiovascular health, high blood pressure, and cholesterol issues.\nConsistent exercise contributes to the enhancement of children's cognitive development. There's ample evidence supporting the role of regular exercise in optimizing bodily functions. Physical activity improves respiratory efficiency, thereby increasing oxygen supply to all organs, including the brain. Engaging in daily exercise offers children a mental reprieve, enhancing their learning efficiency.\nIntroducing children to regular exercise early on underscores the lifelong value of physical activity. Despite frequent lectures on nutrition and exercise, practical application would benefit children more. Moreover, by maintaining this routine, they can develop a lifelong habit of daily physical activity. \nIntegrating physical activity into the school day for children is of paramount importance.

Thus, I support only to a certain extent that in the modern era, images serve as a more effective means of communication.\nTo begin with, images have the power to shape people's perceptions. For instance, currently, alarming images are printed on cigarette packages to demonstrate the dangers of smoking. Consequently, data reveals a slight decrease in the number of smokers, suggesting they are recognizing the harmful effects of their habit. Additionally, the impactful photograph taken by Kevin Carter, depicting a malnourished Sudanese child suffering from severe poverty, has effectively brought attention to the hardships faced by the people in Sudan. Moreover, images are also extensively utilized in newspapers, magazines, and advertisements. Therefore, it is indisputable that images, even without accompanying text, can capture the interest of many.\nFrom an alternative viewpoint, written words are essential for conveying certain messages. when only pictures are used, individuals are left to interpret them based on their own perceptions. Nevertheless, this situation changes when words are used to clarify the meaning of the image. Furthermore, this method is also the primary means of educating students. today's academic textbooks include both words and images to help readers understand more thoroughly.\nIn summary, images and words complement each other, and it is impossible to focus exclusively on just one, whether it be images or words.

Nevertheless, some individuals are concerned that the economic objectives in industrialized nations might be achieved at the cost of environmental health. In my opinion, I believe thriving economies can coexist harmoniously with environmental conservation.\nCertainly, certain nations might prioritize economic growth over environmental safeguarding, leading to ecological degradation. Given that these struggling countries lack sufficient financial and human resources, sophisticated technologies, and expertise, they must depend on natural resources to sustain their standard of living. Additionally, individuals in impoverished regions are unlikely to possess the knowledge needed to protect ecosystems. Consequently, unregulated and irresponsible exploitation of local raw materials may occur, which can stress the natural resources. From this perspective, economic advancement and environmental conservation can be at odds.\nOn the other hand, I am convinced that economic prosperity can be intricately connected to environmental sustainability. As people's awareness of eco-friendly economies grows, pollution-free products are becoming more popular among consumers, indicating that environmentally friendly enterprises can appeal to customers today, driving sales. Take, for instance, electric bicycles powered by clean energy sources have gained significant popularity among the public recently.\nMoreover, considering environmental impacts can improve operational efficiency. An environmentally aware company might need to utilize its resources optimally to enhance its production processes and equipment, which can increase productivity. Thus, it could accelerate economic growth. Conversely, without the obligation of environmental protection, a company would still consume a large amount of energy, which represents a significant portion of its operational expenses, posing a challenge to economic growth.\nIn summary, I would assert that vigorous economies and ecosystem protection can be advanced concurrently.

This occurs as certain harmful substances in cigarettes can quickly deteriorate an individual's respiratory system upon inhalation. As a result, smoking inside restaurants should be completely prohibited since it transforms the restaurant into a polluted environment, endangering the health of all patrons.\nMoreover, although some patrons may not be concerned about the risks posed by second-hand smoke, the unpleasant smoke can ruin their appetite, effectively spoiling their dining experience. Smoke exhaled by smokers often leads to discomfort or disgust among others, negatively impacting their mood during meals. Additionally, This can indirectly harm the restaurant's reputation and reduce its popularity because many customers may choose not to return due to their negative experiences.\nFinally, smoking offers no benefits to the smoker. It not only damages their health, making them more prone to respiratory issues, but also tarnishes their public image. Furthermore, This is particularly relevant if the smoker is a well-known political figure or a celebrity in the entertainment industry, as the majority of people perceive smoking in restaurants as an impolite and inappropriate behavior. In this regard, the public tends to view such smokers as lacking basic decency, deeming them unsuitable for leadership roles.\nIn conclusion, smoking in a restaurant is not only harmful but also disrespectful. It damages the smoker's reputation while posing health risks to others. Consequently, smoking in restaurants and other public settings is a poor choice, and state laws should be enacted to strictly forbid it.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay214", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 175, "to": 299}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 308, "to": 426}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 449, "to": 615}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 648, "to": 779}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 795, "to": 902}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 919, "to": 1034}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1049, "to": 1107}], "label": "Claim", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1114, "to": 1209}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1308, "to": 1398}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1400, "to": 1520}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1536, "to": 1614}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1623, "to": 1696}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1707, "to": 1747}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1749, "to": 1866}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1881, "to": 2002}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2007, "to": 2103}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2121, "to": 2229}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2246, "to": 2312}], "label": "Claim", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2314, "to": 2384}], "label": "Premise", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2400, "to": 2521}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 19}], "edges": [{"source": 4, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 17, "target": 18, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 6, 8, 12, 17, 19]}

While it is evident that some developed nations and international organizations extend financial aid to struggling countries, it is argued that this is neither the most effective nor the sole method to support developing nations. This argument will be substantiated by examining the importance of advancing education and evaluating the true intentions of those providing assistance.\nTo begin with, education plays a pivotal role in the progress and development of any nation. For example, many developing nations suffer from a scarcity of educational resources, such as skilled educators, robust evaluation frameworks, and adequate teaching infrastructure, which are often overlooked by local governments. This example clearly illustrates that without the willingness of developed nations to share their proven educational expertise, developing countries will struggle to progress, even if they receive substantial economic aid. Consequently, the most effective strategy to enhance the conditions in impoverished nations is to assist them in establishing a comprehensive educational framework rather than merely providing financial assistance.\nMoreover, it is a common understanding that nothing in life comes for free. This implies that some influential nations offer financial aid with the ulterior motive of gaining control over local resources and exploiting the workforce. In fact, they seldom provide technological support to local communities and, in some cases, significantly contribute to environmental degradation. As a result, developing nations should avoid becoming overly reliant on financial contributions from powerful countries.\nIn summary, monetary assistance alone is not sufficient to uplift impoverished nations.

They often choose phones not just for their practical features but also for their brand prestige. Additionally, such branded phones usually come with a hefty price tag. Furthermore, a majority of these young individuals are still students, and as a result, they often rely on their parents to financially support their desires.

{"id": "id_356", "input": "The debate over whether universities should allocate funds to enhance facilities rather than employing renowned educators is quite contentious and multifaceted. Some individuals advocate for schools to prioritize upgrading facilities, whereas others believe that hiring distinguished teachers is more advantageous for students. After thorough reflection, I have formed my own opinion. I am inclined towards the former approach, which is why I favor investing in facility enhancement. \nThe primary reason hinges on the undeniable truth that the presence of more sophisticated facilities enhances opportunities for expanding knowledge. For instance, libraries serve as excellent venues for student study and research. Students can focus on their subjects within a serene environment, and access numerous references. This convenient and multi-functional facility aids students in optimizing their learning conditions. Consequently, we can begin to acknowledge that certain facilities offer significant benefits to students. \nMoreover, another equally important factor is that students aren't confined to classrooms all the time. They engage in a plethora of activities within the school. Imagine a student participating in a school jazz ensemble. They require a superior auditorium to deliver an exceptional performance. Such an outstanding performance would leave the student with a memorable and enriching experience etched in their memory. Drawing from this example, we can assert that students would favor schools investing in facility enhancements.\nOn the flip side, some individuals may argue that schools should allocate funds to recruit esteemed educators because they are capable of effectively educating their students. Nevertheless, from my perspective, I question the reliability of that assertion due to its lack of prudence. A student's success is not determined by having a renowned teacher but by their dedication to studying.

Underdeveloped countries require assistance from wealthier nations in these sectors to advance their development.\nTo begin with, In terms of healthcare, less affluent countries typically have fewer doctors and nurses compared to wealthier ones. The high population in these countries, due to inadequate family planning, leads to a disproportion between medical professionals and residents. Moreover, These nations also face a shortage of hospitals to meet patient demands. Addressing these challenges, Wealthier countries can aid by sending medical professionals and financially supporting hospital construction.\nIn the realm of education, In educational matters, it is widely acknowledged that less wealthy countries often lack sufficient teachers and lecturers. Furthermore, Education in these regions is generally not free, limiting access to a select group of students. To tackle the shortage of educational personnel, Wealthier nations could provide skilled educators to train more teachers and lecturers in these countries. Meanwhile, Regarding educational costs, wealthier countries should offer scholarships and loans to deserving students.\nFinally, In the trade sector, it's undeniable that poorer nations are falling behind due to financial constraints. Trade activities are less vibrant in poorer regions partly due to inadequate transportation infrastructure. For instance, People in rural areas often rely on personal farming for food production. As a gesture of goodwill, Affluent countries can offer financial services to stimulate trade in poorer regions. Additionally, they can advise on establishing comprehensive and efficient transportation systems to bolster trade.\nIn summary, Wealthier nations ought to take greater responsibility for assisting less developed countries in healthcare, education, and trade.

In this essay, I will discuss why I believe that people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy is important. \nFirstly, most people's lives are filled with tasks that they don't enjoy doing. In personal life, we have certain duties towards others, and no one enjoys all of these obligations. For example, household chores are quite challenging for me, and even though my husband assists with some, they remain my responsibility. I really dislike all of them, yet I must do them. \nSecondly, professional life is filled with tasks that are essential components of the job. No one enjoys attending tedious meetings or working with someone who is difficult to get along with. I am a research assistant at a university, and like many institutions, we have a professor who is not adept at interpersonal relationships; most assistants dislike discussing issues with him, even though we need his expertise. \nThirdly, doing something an individual doesn't enjoy can lead to unexpected enjoyment. Sometimes people participate in activities at the insistence of friends, even if they are initially unwilling. For instance, a friend suggested a dance class to my husband and me, which we were not keen on. After some persuasion from friends, we joined and had a great time, continuing for six months even as most of our friends dropped out after a month.\nNo one leads a life filled entirely with enjoyment; there are often dull and unpleasant aspects in life that no one enjoys, yet they are largely about responsibilities that are integral to individual lives.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay330", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 370, "to": 426}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 451, "to": 520}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 522, "to": 621}], "label": "Claim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 636, "to": 758}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 760, "to": 808}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 821, "to": 900}], "label": "Claim", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 902, "to": 1001}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1003, "to": 1228}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1240, "to": 1316}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1318, "to": 1427}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1443, "to": 1523}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1525, "to": 1672}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1726, "to": 1879}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 12}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 2, 5, 8, 12]}

Students engaged in online learning can reduce their travel time, tuition costs, and textbook expenses simply by using an internet connection. This is particularly impactful for children residing in remote areas and those from families facing financial hardships.\nIn addition, listance education grants students the chance to tap into extensive knowledge bases and diverse teaching methodologies.

These elements play a vital role in offering instant feedback and nurturing students' personalities. However, with advancements in streaming and sensor technology, remote learning can overcome the barriers of distance and physical contact.\nIn summary, I acknowledge that traditional schooling holds certain strengths, such as feedback and inspiration, that are difficult to replace shortly.

I wholeheartedly agree with this statement.\nIn recent times, the percentage of women is increasing annually in many regions around the world. This naturally leads to this issue encourages stakeholders from diverse areas to consider the necessary preparations for stabilizing economic growth and improving people's quality of life. It is evident now that women are increasingly working in fields traditionally dominated by men, such as engineering and machine-related roles. These activities have demonstrated that women are equally capable of performing jobs traditionally held by men. Consequently, female students are shown to have the same potential and abilities as their male counterparts.\nAnother reason is the importance of obtaining a higher education degree, as it is essential for establishing a person's career. Nowadays, it is very challenging for young individuals to secure a decent job without a degree from a university. Therefore, historically, education has equipped individuals with the knowledge and experience needed to tackle real-world workplace situations, as taught in college.

{"id": "id_361", "input": "Currently, the rising unemployment rate is a hot topic of discussion. Some argue that a viable solution is to equip the unemployed with smartphones that have internet access, claiming it is the best use of public funds. However, I partly concur with this notion as I believe that providing mobile phones to the unemployed is a complete misuse of financial resources.\nFrom a positive angle, when unemployed individuals have smartphones with internet access, they can explore a wider range of job opportunities online. For instance, they can browse The Star Online's employment section to discover jobs that match their skills. the internet also allows them to conduct further research on potential jobs and learn how to prepare for them. Additionally, the smartphones can be used to contact companies where they wish to apply. In essence, if the government supplies mobile phones to the unemployed, they will have a better chance of securing employment to support themselves.\nConversely, from a different viewpoint, distributing smartphones to the jobless is a misuse of taxpayers' money. This is because funds could be redirected towards more beneficial national projects. To further illustrate, the funds could be allocated for public infrastructure or assistance to the needy to help them earn a living. Ultimately, these funds could be better spent on other initiatives rather than on providing smartphones to the unemployed.\nMoreover, if smartphones are distributed for free, many individuals may look to exploit this opportunity. it's conceivable that some might intentionally become jobless to receive a smartphone. some could even falsely claim unemployment to qualify for the phones. In this scenario, this results in a futile expenditure of public funds. Additionally, to date, there is no concrete evidence or surveys proving this method effectively reduces unemployment rates.\nIn conclusion, the idea of distributing smartphones with internet access to the unemployed is neither an effective nor ideal strategy to reduce unemployment. I propose that the government should thoroughly assess individuals' backgrounds before distributing smartphones. I firmly believe that public funds should be used for the greater good of society, rather than on individuals who are unwilling to exert additional effort to secure a suitable job.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay084", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 280, "to": 365}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 390, "to": 515}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 531, "to": 624}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 626, "to": 735}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 751, "to": 824}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 838, "to": 973}], "label": "Claim", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1015, "to": 1086}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1104, "to": 1171}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1196, "to": 1304}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1318, "to": 1427}], "label": "Claim", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1439, "to": 1533}], "label": "Claim", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1535, "to": 1620}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1622, "to": 1690}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1710, "to": 1762}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1778, "to": 1886}], "label": "Claim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1915, "to": 2044}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 15}], "edges": [{"source": 5, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 13, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 5, 9, 10, 14, 15]}

In my opinion, enhancing roads and highways is the most viable solution to these issues due to three key factors.\nFirstly, it's widely recognized that improving public transport will likely increase pollution and accidents. Vehicles such as buses, cars, and trains frequently release harmful gases that lead to severe illnesses like lung cancer and pneumonia. Additionally, the noise from engines can damage our hearing. Most significantly, numerous road accidents occur. For instance, in my nation, buses are often blamed for the sharp increase in accidents. Annually, Vietnam experiences nearly twelve thousand fatalities from accidents annually, comparable to Japan's tsunami death toll.\nSecondly, investing in roads and highways can expand the space, facilitating more public transport operations. Not only buses but also private vehicles can navigate the roads more smoothly. For example, I often leave school when everyone is rushing onto the roads to head home quickly. Escaping the crowded roads within an hour is quite challenging for me. Conversely, if the roads are widened, people can reach home faster with minimal collisions. \nFinally, allocating funds to refurbish highways and roads can enhance their quality. Everyone dreads traversing rough roads filled with potholes. These poor conditions lead to numerous severe accidents and cause considerable anxiety. Drivers shouldn't be blamed for accidents, as some of the accountability lies with the authorities.

{"id": "id_363", "input": "There is a growing debate about whether governments should allocate funds to enhance roads and highways or prioritize public transportation. Personally, I firmly believe that governments should undoubtedly focus on investing in the public transportation system, as it effectively addresses the challenges posed by the increasing number of private vehicles.\nTo begin with, utilizing public transportation significantly decreases the consumption of resources in transportation. Private cars rely heavily on gasoline, a finite and non-renewable resource, which highlights the fact that the more cars that are in use, the faster we deplete the world's gasoline reserves. On the other hand, when public transportation is used efficiently, the per-person gasoline consumption is drastically reduced, and this contributes significantly to conserving our precious natural resource, gasoline.\nFurthermore, public transportation plays a crucial role in mitigating air pollution. On average, public transport vehicles consume far less gasoline per passenger compared to private cars, and This translates to less exhaust emissions polluting the air, relieving people from enduring heavily polluted roads filled with fumes.\nFinally, using public transportation offers a much safer option compared to driving private vehicles, supported by the fact that Data from the National Safety Council reveals that taking a bus is over 170 times safer than driving a private car. Hence, governments have every reason to prioritize investments in public transportation, which is a safe, healthy, and cost-effective mode of travel.\nIn conclusion, I strongly assert that investing in public transportation is an essential step forward since it is fundamental to safeguarding our planet and ensuring a safe, healthy living environment for everyone.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay198", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 175, "to": 260}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 265, "to": 355}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 372, "to": 474}], "label": "Claim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 476, "to": 550}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 583, "to": 665}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 686, "to": 792}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 798, "to": 882}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 897, "to": 967}], "label": "Claim", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 981, "to": 1071}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1077, "to": 1209}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1220, "to": 1311}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1340, "to": 1454}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1463, "to": 1604}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1644, "to": 1707}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1714, "to": 1819}], "label": "Claim", "id": 14}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 7, 12, 13, 14]}

Although some people agree that learning through television is more beneficial for certain children, I find it hard to support the notion of students spending increased time watching TV. This is because traditional education remains widely considered the most suitable approach. Therefore, encouraging physical inactivity for enhancing youngsters' abilities is not advisable.\nFirstly, conventional teaching methods have been scientifically validated and widely adopted as the optimal way to educate children. Technological advancements have positively impacted the education sector to some extent. Nonetheless, it has not diminished the critical role of teachers in the classroom. The fact that today's students often use computers for homework and research instead of visiting libraries, illustrating this point. Yet, screens cannot take the place of teachers in person as their expertise and adaptability are invaluable. Consequently, teachers cannot be substituted by unfeeling screens. \nSecondly, watching TV is a passive activity and should not be promoted by extending time spent on it. In contrast, children engaging in activities fostering creativity, teamwork, and competition generally perform better overall. For example, an experiment demonstrated that children exposed to various activities in nature outperformed those who spent most of their time watching documentaries in distinguishing types of plants or animals. As a result, such activities can provide children with essential skills useful for their future careers.\nIn summary, even though some children benefit from learning via television, children should never be encouraged to partake in such passive activities.

{"id": "id_365", "input": "There is an ongoing heated discussion about whether direct, in-person communication surpasses other forms of interaction, with the topic's complexity allowing for various perspectives. Some individuals advocate for face-to-face communication as the superior method of expressing oneself, while others hold contrary views. After careful consideration, I have formed my own opinion. I support the former; that is, I agree that face-to-face communication is better. \nThe primary reason for this is the undeniable fact that communicating in person can be more convincing. Sometimes, face-to face communication can lead us to convince or complain someone successfully, and a fitting example can be found from my uncle. He once complained a service of a restaurant. Without exaggeration, he directly went to the boss and told the boss that something wrong occurred on the meal--a fly concealed in it. Afterward, my uncle acquired a new service thanks to face-to face communication. If he just wrote something to complain on the website or by telephone, I do not think this problem would be thought important. Consequently, we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way. \nBesides the reason mentioned above, another crucial aspect is that it is easy to be deceived without face-to face communication. For example, I had received some harmful words on facebook from my best friend, Eric. He said that I was totally failed in building a good friendship and he did not want to be one of my friends anymore. I just shocked and did not know what happened. Eventually, I realized that his facebook account was stolen. Thus, from this incident, we are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face-to-face. \nAdmittedly, there are those who argue that communication by letters, email, or telephone can enable them to talk without scruple, which is also one of the most important parts in communication. Nevertheless, from my limited understanding, I question the reliability of that assertion. It is conceivable that before we talk, it is necessary for us to be imprudent about our words. Talking without scruple is not the indispensable part in communication; in contrast, it is usually detrimental to us. \nConsidering the arguments presented above, I prefer to express my opinion in person because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. Simply put, I believe the best way of communication is by means of face-to-face. This is not to say that alternative viewpoints lack merit entirely.

{"id": "id_366", "input": "The rise in street crime, prompting the police to arm themselves with firearms, has emerged as a pressing concern for many in today's society. Some believe that this trend mirrors and amplifies the heightened violence within society. I fully concur with this perspective for various reasons, which will be explored and dissected in the upcoming sections.\nFirstly, it's essential to recognize that police officers equipped with firearms or other legal weapons aim to safeguard both civilians and themselves. Consequently, today's criminals are highly sophisticated, investing substantial resources to obtain advanced weaponry for their own illicit purposes and to confront law enforcement. Hence, members of such a society face the risk of being unintentionally shot by either the police or criminals. Furthermore, during operations, not only are ordinary citizens impacted, but also infrastructure like vehicles, homes, and streets is prone to gun-related destruction. Therefore, a society where the police are armed with guns is undoubtedly perceived as exceptionally violent.\nSecondly, police officers carry firearms predominantly in societies with high crime rates. As a result, those societies typically contend with dangerous and varied criminal activities, including theft, robbery, murder, sexual assault, vandalism, and arson. Clearly, These instances serve as some of the most compelling evidence of a society grappling with severe violence.\nIn conclusion, despite the aforementioned viewpoints, although arming the police force with guns is essential, it will lead to an escalation in violence.

{"id": "id_367", "input": "People have diverse preferences when it comes to learning methods. Personally, I believe learning independently and learning with the guidance of a teacher are both valuable. Having a teacher can help avoid confusion and significantly enhance the pace and efficiency of learning. Moreover, for certain practical skills, guidance from a teacher is essential. However, there are times when I prefer to study independently.\nAn experienced and skilled teacher can make learning quicker and more straightforward for me. When I try to grasp a challenging and confusing subject on my own, especially when resources are scarce, I often feel discouraged after investing significant time. In such cases, I seek out a teacher to assist me. The teacher will then explain the subject efficiently within a short period, which means this helps me learn faster and more effectively, avoiding confusion and discouragement.\nThere are certain hands-on skills that can only be mastered with the help of a teacher or instructor. For instance, For example, learning to drive a car, practicing professions like medicine or engineering, or engaging in sports such as skiing or swimming requires a teacher's guidance. Learning these skills independently is nearly impractical and ineffective. Additionally, When self-learning, there is a chance of acquiring incorrect knowledge or understanding! For example, From my experience, when I started learning to play the guitar without a teacher, I developed bad habits with strumming and timing. However, once I found a tutor, they helped me recognize and correct those mistakes, allowing me to play properly.\nThere are certain subjects I prefer to study without the involvement of a teacher because This saves me the expense of hiring a teacher and eliminates the need to commute to classes, saving time. Nowadays, there is a wealth of excellent resources available, such as books, e-books, online platforms, television, and satellite channels. These resources serve as effective tutorials for learning numerous subjects. For example, For example, I can learn English or other languages using a variety of helpful books and online websites.\nTo conclude, there are situations where it is beneficial to learn both with a teacher and independently.

Nevertheless, the situation is more complex than it appears. \nIndeed, tougher gun laws do not necessarily lead to a drop in violence and crime because the majority of gun-related crimes are committed with firearms obtained through illegal means. Individuals determined to engage in criminal activities and dominate urban areas through gang warfare will find ways to access guns, despite regulatory controls. \nFurthermore, non-law-abiding individuals exist globally, whether they are law enforcement or ordinary citizens. Consequently, the true source of violence is the criminal mindset, not the firearms themselves. Hence, to effectively manage crime within a community, a government should focus on moderating the behavior of its populace rather than the guns used in violent acts. \nOverall, it is clear that the correlation between police officers carrying guns and rising violence rates is weak.

Many individuals could work their entire lives and never come close to earning such figures. This glaring income disparity between these celebrities and the average person raises a question: do professional athletes and entertainers truly merit such high earnings? From my perspective, I firmly believe that they are indeed worthy of such substantial earnings.\nTo begin with, a person's earnings are a reflection of their skills and the value they bring to their profession. As a result, individuals who earn significantly high wages typically outperform others and accomplish remarkable feats in their respective fields. Additionally, Their earnings are not arbitrary or without justification. In today's competitive world, individuals must demonstrate exceptional capability to convince employers that they merit higher compensation. This principle holds true across all professions. For this reason, the highest-earning athletes are often the top performers in their domains, such as Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods.\nMoreover, these substantial salaries also help ensure and sustain the athletes' stellar performances. Many only see the glamorous lives of wealthy athletes and overlook the immense challenges and investments they endure to reach their level of success. Their exceptional efforts and sacrifices justify their high earnings. Put differently, if their compensation doesn\u2019t align with their extraordinary performances, we might not witness the same level of excellence that captivates us.\nCritics might contend that the vast income gap between wealthy athletes and average individuals appears unjust. Nevertheless, I think as long as everyone has an equal opportunity to follow their ambitions and careers, the system remains fair. Fairness is not about ensuring identical earnings for everyone, but about providing equal opportunities to strive for the same achievements.\nIn summary, high earnings for athletes are both a rightful reward for their accomplishments and a necessary incentive for exceptional performances.

Moreover, The Internet enables us to access information globally at any time, which implies that mass media no longer primarily aim to inform people but instead focus on maintaining high ratings and readership numbers. \nSecondly, we live in a culture where appearances and gossip are highly valued. Today, intrusive paparazzi relentlessly follow public figures just to capture moments of their daily routines, such as eating or exercising. Magazines are frequently criticized for engaging in checkbook journalism, where they pay individuals significant sums for exclusive stories or photos. Furthermore, Reality TV shows, such as \"Big Brother,\" place participants in contrived environments and situations purely for entertainment.\nIn conclusion, it is evident that television, newspapers, and magazines excessively focus on people's personal lives to boost ratings and readership while catering to a society driven by sensationalist media and tabloid-style entertainment.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay307", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 314, "to": 372}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 404, "to": 499}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 501, "to": 623}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 635, "to": 701}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 722, "to": 842}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 855, "to": 922}], "label": "Claim", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 924, "to": 1063}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1065, "to": 1214}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1229, "to": 1354}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1390, "to": 1595}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 9}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 5, 9]}

Some individuals argue that the multitude of ads persuade people to purchase items that are not essential and merely appear attractive on screen. Personally, I find myself in agreement with this perspective.\nTo enhance their revenue and attract customers, businesses invest heavily in advertising. Often, the focus is not on the actual utility or quality of the products, but rather on the appeal of owning them. What I mean is, large corporations employ celebrities to endorse their products. By featuring popular singers in commercials for motorcycles or apparel, for instance, sales experience a notable increase because young people, who are the targeted consumers, idolize celebrities. Since possessing such items reflects their social standing, the actual quality is evidently of lesser concern.\nYet, although advertisements can sometimes be misleading and overstated, it's undeniable that it holds significant economic importance. They unveil new products, offer a range of options, and are often visually appealing, as their primary goal is to capture your interest. Advertising contributes to keeping prices competitive and fosters a balanced environment for commercial rivalry. Without it, the market might become monopolistic, limiting both price flexibility and choice.\nThough the influence of advertising may be overstated, we must acknowledge that the ultimate decision rests with us as consumers.

{"id": "id_373", "input": "In recent years, the internet has gained immense popularity, offering individuals a vast reservoir of information. Consequently, traditional print media like newspapers have witnessed a significant drop in readership. While some people maintain that newspapers can endure over time, others contend that newspapers have lost their competitive edge to ensure their long-term survival. Personally, I lean towards the latter perspective for the reasons outlined below.\nFirstly, accessing information via the internet is faster and more convenient than perusing newspapers. Unlike in the past when people had to wait for hours to receive a daily newspaper, today they can get the latest news updated every second through their smartphones or computers with internet access, anywhere and at any time. These gadgets are ubiquitous worldwide, enabling individuals to read a multitude of content that newspapers cannot encapsulate within a few pages. Therefore, print media has lost its significant role in delivering information.\nMoreover, from a financial viewpoint, purchasing newspapers seems wasteful when the internet is accessible to everyone. It is apparent that internet services are offered at a minimal cost or even free in numerous countries. The question then becomes whether a person would choose to spend extra money on newspapers for information that is often less comprehensive than what the internet provides. The likely answer is that few sensible individuals would make such a choice. Consequently, the readership of newspapers might continue to decline sharply, potentially leading to the closure of many in the near future.\nLastly, considering the environmental aspect, it is important to realize that increased newspaper production results in more trees being felled. This is a direct contributor to the ongoing deforestation occurring globally today. In light of this, newspaper production will likely have to contend with environmentalists in its struggle to survive.\nIn summary, while it may be disheartening for newspaper advocates to witness the decline of this media type, such an occurrence should be viewed as a consequence of the relentless advancements in media technology and the evolution of modern life as a whole.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay007", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 303, "to": 381}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 474, "to": 567}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 569, "to": 793}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 795, "to": 940}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 953, "to": 1020}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1032, "to": 1140}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1162, "to": 1244}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1419, "to": 1494}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1510, "to": 1635}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1645, "to": 1780}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1782, "to": 1864}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1884, "to": 1982}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}], "edges": [{"source": 4, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 4, 8, 11]}

While a mother's role is undeniably crucial in a child's upbringing, I strongly concur with the notion that fatherhood is equally essential to healthy parenting as motherhood. \nThe primary reason that the father's role should hold the same importance as the mother's role lies in the fundamental nature of parenting. From my perspective, the examples set by parents within a family significantly influence the shaping of a child's personality and traits. For instance, in a traditional Turkish family, while the mother typically offers warmth and compassion, the father is expected to provide an authoritative and conservative presence to ensure the child grows up disciplined and respectful. \nAnother reason for believing that fatherhood is as crucial as motherhood is the evolving dynamics of modern relationships. I believe that we now live in a society that highly values gender equality across all facets of life, including partnerships and family roles. For example, the traditional family model, where the woman assumes the role of a housewife managing the household and children while the man serves as the sole breadwinner, is no longer the prevailing norm. Moreover, responsibilities within relationships are now shared and alternated equally between partners.

Rushing through tasks while risking errors means merely going through the motions to meet deadlines. Ultimately, this approach accomplishes the task superficially, rendering it rather futile. Improving our ability to work should be our focus, rather than simply completing tasks. Without a doubt, it might take longer to match others if we need to repeatedly review our work, but with consistent effort, we will soon enhance our speed in task completion.\nSecondly, besides accuracy, the world also demands efficiency, which includes quick completion and quality standards. Even if we keep up by ignoring project details and focusing only on its general outline, it won't be satisfying for companies and clients. We will eventually be left behind despite keeping up with the pace because when issues arise, we'll need to revisit and rectify our errors.

{"id": "id_377", "input": "In today's world, automobiles have become one of the most essential modes of transportation for daily activities. The widespread ownership and usage of cars highlight their undeniable importance. Broadly speaking, I strongly support the view that cars have enhanced the quality of modern life, and there are several reasons to back this claim.\nTo begin with, vehicles enable people to cover long distances in a short time, bringing numerous benefits. This is evident in areas such as personal relationships, where many individuals can now maintain long-distance relationships because they can frequently visit one another using their car. Reflecting on my own experiences, I remember that my car has been invaluable in allowing me to reconnect with childhood friends despite living in a different city. Moreover, I was also able to build a relationship with someone living 89 kilometers away, and Thanks to my car, we were able to meet every weekend, and today we remain a happy couple. Without the convenience of my automobile, our relationship might never have developed underscores this point.\nAdditionally, cars improve employment opportunities, mainly because people can commute to work and take jobs farther away from home. In this regard, this makes them more adaptable plays a crucial role. For instance, My father, for instance, worked across Germany and earned a higher income as a result. He traveled by car to distant parts of the country, worked there during the week, and returned home on weekends, and Without his car, he wouldn't have been able to see his family on weekends, making the automobile invaluable both financially and socially.\nLastly, cars enable frequent travel, allowing people to explore and experience the world. This is particularly true since those without cars are likely to remain confined to their hometowns or villages for most of their lives. public transportation often restricts access to certain areas also demonstrates the limitations of alternatives like public transportation.

This diversity in learning styles raises the question of whether it is essential for university students to attend classes as long as they are capable of passing their exams. From my perspective, I firmly assert that students should consistently participate in classes regardless of their exam outcomes. \nTo begin with, when it comes to learning, attending lectures proves more beneficial than solitary study aimed solely at passing exams. Lectures are meticulously structured for learners, and professors possess a wealth of knowledge that exceeds that of the students. Professors bring both expertise and experience, enabling them to adeptly steer students toward academic success. \nMoreover, it is fundamentally the duty of students to attend lectures. Showing up for class is the most compelling way for students to demonstrate respect for both the professor and themselves. Attendance is often a factor in how professors assess their students. Put differently, attendance in classes is deemed just as vital as performance in exams. Individuals who excel in exams might still fail if they neglect to attend lectures.\nThere are those who might contend that students might perceive the course material well enough to pass exams or feel capable of self-directed learning. Why squander time sitting in lectures? Isn't self-study more productive? Nonetheless, I maintain that this reflects a rather presumptuous mindset. I am convinced that professors can offer insights beyond what students can achieve on their own due to their expertise and credentials. Furthermore, even if students consider themselves exceptionally bright, they can still benefit from engaging with professors and peers in class. \nIn summary, students can gain a deeper understanding and also show respect for educators and themselves by attending lectures.

Nevertheless, when we delve into the matter of competition versus cooperation, our focus shifts from society as a whole to the lifelong personal development of individuals. From this perspective, I am convinced that cooperation should be prioritized during early education.\nTo begin with, cooperation helps children develop interpersonal skills that are crucial for their future. Teamwork teaches not only how to achieve common goals but also, more importantly, how to interact well with others. Through collaboration, children learn to listen to others, communicate effectively, think comprehensively, and even compromise when conflicts arise. These skills enable them to build good relationships and will be advantageous throughout their lives.\nConversely, competition's importance lies in striving for excellence to achieve victory. Thus, it is frequently asserted that competition enhances societal efficiency. Nonetheless, while pondering how to win, it becomes clear that cooperation is essential. The loftier our ambitions, the greater the necessity for competition. Consider the Olympics, a competitive arena where winning is nearly impossible without the guidance of coaches and support from professionals managing diet and healthcare. While the athlete stands victorious, the triumph is shared by the entire team.

Personally, I am of the strong opinion that online classes should never replace classroom learning. Here are my reasons.\nFirstly, it's clear that classroom learning is superior to online classes when it comes to delivering education. In a classroom setting, you can gain insights from your peers, as observing classmates who excel can motivate you to enhance your own performance. For instance, During my first year of B Com, I was not very focused on my studies, but seeing some friends earn better grades inspired me to improve my academic performance. Ultimately I achieved the top rank in the final exam.\nSecondly, classroom learning requires you to complete study tasks on schedule. This enhances your ability to manage time effectively. Additionally, by engaging in group study sessions, you learn effective communication with others. This improves your communication and teamwork skills, which are beneficial for your future career.\nThirdly, professors are crucial in classroom learning, as they are often experts in their fields, offering valuable knowledge and skills. Working under a professor allows you to ask questions face-to-face, clarifying any uncertainties. Consequently learning occurs more rapidly. For instance, based on my own experience, Initially, I relied on online courses for TOEFL IBT preparation, but after a month, realizing my time was not well spent, I enrolled in an institute for TOEFL IBT preparation and noticed significant improvement in my English skills within a month.\nIt\u2019s undeniable that online classes offer certain benefits and can serve as a supplement, yet they cannot replace traditional classroom learning. \nFrom the above discussion, it is evident that for these reasons, classroom learning remains the best method for providing education.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay297", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 214, "to": 268}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 316, "to": 402}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 404, "to": 465}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 470, "to": 549}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 565, "to": 723}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 736, "to": 777}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 789, "to": 856}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 858, "to": 911}], "label": "Claim", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 927, "to": 1009}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1011, "to": 1108}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1119, "to": 1246}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1248, "to": 1344}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1359, "to": 1387}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1431, "to": 1677}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1700, "to": 1767}], "label": "Claim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1773, "to": 1823}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1872, "to": 1957}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 16}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 15, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 1, 7, 12, 14, 16]}

Consequently, Young learners at the start of their education are quicker and more adept at grasping a foreign language than older individuals. They can effortlessly comprehend linguistic structures and retain vocabulary. Undoubtedly, The retention of learned knowledge during childhood surpasses that of other life stages.

{"id": "id_382", "input": "When we refer to a student, we typically mean a boy or a girl attending school or college. In some countries, teenagers have the chance to engage in part-time work alongside their studies. Yet, there are individuals who oppose the idea of teenagers working while studying. From my perspective, it is beneficial for teenagers to undertake part-time work while they are still students, and I have two reasons for this.\nThe primary reason is that students can acquire a wealth of knowledge from part-time jobs before embarking on their professional careers. They can gain insights into time management, financial management, and persuasion skills. For instance, During my high school years, I spent a year working as a salesperson in a shop. Because I had to allocate some of my time to work, hence, I was compelled to manage my time effectively. I had to coordinate with my boss and complete my homework. This experience taught me how to efficiently manage time and perform tasks swiftly and effectively. Furthermore, I learned about financial management. In the absence of my boss, I was responsible for managing the shop's accounts. Through this, I gained knowledge on how to handle money accurately. This experience demonstrated that part-time work can impart valuable lessons to students.\nAnother reason is that students can earn money from part-time jobs, which can provide financial support to their families. For example, during my high school years, I worked as a home tutor. I taught math to two children from my neighborhood, helping them grasp challenging topics from their textbooks. By tutoring, I earned money which I used to purchase my own books. Additionally, after taking on that part-time role, I stopped relying on my parents for pocket money. As demonstrated, part-time employment can enable students to earn money, thus assisting their families financially.\nIn conclusion, I am aware that some individuals will disagree with the notion of students having part-time jobs. They might claim, it can distract students from their studies. Nonetheless, since I held a part-time job during high school, and it did not negatively impact my academic performance; hence, I am convinced part-time work is advantageous for students.

Personally, animals should inhabit their natural environments rather than zoos.\nFirstly, wild species have a right to exist in spaces separate from human intervention. Considering humans are accountable for the extensive pollution and significant damage to the natural settings of numerous wild animals, we must take responsibility to establish a natural and secure habitat for animals. Clearly, the confined areas and artificial foliage and water bodies cannot fully make up for what animals lose. Additionally, prolonged captivity in zoos can adversely affect the physical and mental well-being of wild animals. Consequently, wild creatures are prone to experience solitude and sadness. It appears that zoos tend to act more as threats than as protectors of wildlife.\nOn the other hand, proponents might assert that zoos, equipped with advanced facilities and skilled personnel, offer superior care to the animals they house.

A topic of considerable discussion nowadays is whether the government should bear the responsibility for providing health care and education to its citizens.\nSome individuals contend that the government is responsible for financing citizens' health care and education. This stems from the belief that citizens are entitled to live in a peaceful and stable environment, which the government, as the societal leader, should facilitate. without access to health care and education, individuals risk compromising their physical well-being and mental stability. Consequently, such individuals may not receive timely medical care, thereby affecting their productivity, which could disrupt industrial output. Additionally, lacking proper guidance from educators, these citizens might act out or engage in criminal activities, endangering the safety of others. Thus, it is crucial for the government to be responsible for health care and education to maintain societal security and stability.\nConversely, there are those who oppose this view, arguing that funding health care and education for every citizen is considered an inefficient use of public funds, because many individuals, in reality, can afford to pay for both privately. Instead, the government should prioritize urgent issues affecting community welfare, such as rising crime rates, the AIDS epidemic, or infrastructure shortages, which demand financial intervention.\nIn my view, the government should provide financial support for health care and education to the underprivileged, who genuinely need governmental assistance.

{"id": "id_388", "input": "It is widely recognized that under British and Australian legal systems, juries are not privy to a defendant's previous criminal activities. Some critics argue that this practice ought to be revised and that juries should at least be informed about some aspects of the defendants before reaching a verdict. Personally, I fully endorse this proposal as it offers benefits to various stakeholders, which I will elaborate on below.\nFirstly, I contend that juries would find it simpler to reach a decision if they had access to the defendant's past information. This is because having a thorough knowledge of the defendant's background allows juries to assess the crime more accurately before rendering a judgment. For example, consider an individual who has never committed murder but is suddenly found guilty. Juries can determine whether the crime was committed deliberately or due to extenuating circumstances by understanding the person's history. Consequently, punishments can then be administered according to the situation.\nMoreover, a just trial can be ensured. As we are all aware, juries consist of individuals who possess little to no legal expertise. Therefore, providing them with the defendant's past records can help them think more logically and piece together a more substantial judgment. By doing so, juries will feel reassured that they have reached a better conclusion based on ample evidence. Additionally, the accused will also receive fair treatment.\nIt is undeniable that when the defendant's background is extensively examined and exposed to the public, their privacy is compromised. If they are eventually found innocent, they may feel ashamed to face society. Nonetheless, I am confident that the offenses committed by criminals should be disclosed and the public should be informed to prevent them from becoming victims.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the current method of jury deliberation should be reformed, with juries being informed of the defendant's background. This is crucial to ensure that they will be able to deliver a more accurate, reliable, and fair judgment to the defendant. Positive changes will undoubtedly follow if reforms are implemented, as transformation necessitates change.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay096", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 208, "to": 305}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 453, "to": 556}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 574, "to": 709}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 724, "to": 806}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 808, "to": 947}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 963, "to": 1026}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1038, "to": 1065}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1088, "to": 1158}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1171, "to": 1301}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1316, "to": 1409}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1425, "to": 1469}], "label": "Claim", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1493, "to": 1604}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1606, "to": 1682}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1717, "to": 1844}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1883, "to": 1999}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2032, "to": 2122}], "label": "Claim", "id": 15}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 13, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 1, 10, 11, 14, 15]}

Some argue that a broad knowledge base increases the likelihood of success, while others contend that expertise in a specific field is crucial for achieving success. Both sides present compelling arguments. Personally, I believe that possessing a diverse range of knowledge is essential for success. Below, I will elaborate on my reasoning.\nFirstly, understanding various fields helps one form friendships more easily. For instance, I worked at a large company with numerous departments. I was part of the Management Information System department, where our daily task was to address issues raised by clients over the phone. Even though some issues belonged to the Engineering department, I was able to collaborate with my colleagues there, because I had taken some engineering courses. This made it simpler for me to reach out than anyone else in my department, which boosted my popularity and facilitated the assistance I needed.\nSecondly, when transitioning to a new field, having knowledge of different areas is crucial. Consider my cousin Jeff and his friend as an example. They both studied finance in college but chose to pursue a career in the arts after graduation. Due to Jeff's dedication during his free time, he acquired substantial knowledge about art history. As a result, he became part of an excellent team, while his friend, who only understood finance, ended up working at a bank.\nWhile I acknowledge the importance of understanding various fields, it's necessary to recognize that there are different perspectives. Opponents might argue that if someone cannot excel in their own field, what can they achieve in different areas. This viewpoint might hold some truth. However, what if someone eventually discovers their talent lies in another field. Thus, it wouldn't pose any problem.\nIn conclusion, given the reasons outlined above, when comparing the advantages and disadvantages of having knowledge in diverse fields, the best choice is clearly to side with my view, which is that having a broad understanding of different subjects is indeed vital.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay263", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 403, "to": 467}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 519, "to": 586}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 794, "to": 908}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 918, "to": 954}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 956, "to": 1099}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1111, "to": 1192}], "label": "Claim", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1344, "to": 1442}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1444, "to": 1567}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1731, "to": 1815}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1864, "to": 1935}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2172, "to": 2238}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 10}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 1, 5, 8, 10]}

Conversely, students obtain the majority of their knowledge through teachers and learn to differentiate right from wrong with their guidance.\nThose who assert that students gain much more from other sources like the Internet and television are convinced that through these sources, students discover many things unteachable in traditional classes.

Furthermore, they argue that quality television programs offer educational value to students. For example, Discovery Channel broadcasts numerous educational episodes.

While there are strong arguments supporting the encouragement of this trend, I am of the opinion that cheap flights can lead to numerous serious issues.\nIt is undeniable that affordable airfares have expanded travel opportunities for many individuals, especially those from lower-income backgrounds. Today, millions of people are able to travel globally for work or leisure. This enables them to advance in their careers, expand their knowledge, and engage with people from diverse cultural backgrounds. Moreover, Travel also aids in promoting the growth of the tourism industry, bolstering the economy, and enhancing job markets in many nations.\nOn the other hand, the increase in budget flights significantly impacts the environment negatively. It is apparent that an increase in flights may result in larger and busier airports, potentially escalating air pollution for those living and working nearby. However, the primary concern is its contribution to global warming. The combustion of jet fuel releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which contributes to the warming of the planet. Indeed, while extensive efforts are underway to cut down CO2 emissions from vehicles and industries, no substantial measures are being taken to regulate the airline industry. \nIn conclusion, I would argue that the disadvantages of low-cost airfares surpass the advantages.

They frequently perceive such games as more of a burden than a source of pleasure in their daily routines.\nAdditionally, it should be noted that adults typically don't pursue games competitively, whereas children are always eager for competition and victory. For young people, nurturing their competitive spirit often fosters remarkable traits, regardless of their involvement in sports. For example, my younger sister enjoys fencing, and her competitive drive ensures she perseveres through tough situations or even injury. Conversely, adults often view such behavior as immature and abandon it swiftly. Indeed, a person with a strong competitive streak often struggles to collaborate with peers and colleagues. Consequently, they cease engaging in games for modest accomplishments and gradually lose interest in these pursuits.\nIn conclusion, I believe adults do require games, but their approach differs from children's, being generally less competitive and more focused on enjoyment.

In the past, students who were weary of commuting had no choice but to attend local schools, regardless of the differences in educational facilities, teacher qualifications, or the school's reputation.

Moreover, with video conferencing, a teacher can instruct a larger number of students. As a result, educational institutions can reduce costs by increasing the teacher-to-student ratio. Due to the affordability of online instruction, universities and colleges are able to provide scholarships to students with excellent academic performance who cannot afford to attend school.\nHowever, critics of online degrees argue that attending lectures in person offers students the chance to engage with teachers and peers.

It is the genuine interactions and communication in classrooms that make education more appealing.\nIn conclusion, I believe that distance learning will play an increasingly vital role in the future as life becomes more fast-paced.

Consequently, there is a view among some that tax revenues should be directed towards services that benefit the public rather than the arts. Nonetheless, I am convinced that the arts also deserve to be part of the government's investment portfolio.\nIt is undeniable that priority must be given by the government to public services and infrastructure. This stems from the fact that the government acts as a guiding entity among its citizens and should fulfill its duty of utilizing tax money effectively to ensure the safety and stability of society. At the same time, public services like education and healthcare address fundamental needs such as survival, security, and knowledge, thereby providing comfort and reducing crime rates. Hence, adequate focus on public services and infrastructure is essential for sustaining societal stability.\nConversely, I hold the opinion that the government must not overlook the importance of the arts. On a personal level, arts have the ability to enhance people's cultural experiences. Nowadays, individuals are increasingly burdened with work and studies due to intense competition. As a result, they need various forms of entertainment such as music, movies, or books to relax and relieve stress. In the absence of arts, there is a risk that people could face mental health issues.\nFrom the perspective of the local community, supporting the arts is advantageous for local cultural and economic growth. Cultural heritage plays a significant role within the arts.

{"id": "id_402", "input": "Nowadays, an increasing number of university faculty members are engaging in scientific research. Some fear this trend might compromise the quality of education and advocate for professors to prioritize teaching. Nevertheless, in my view, professors should be encouraged to focus primarily on research activities.\nTo begin with, engaging in research acts as a means of professional development for professors. Universities offer a somewhat insular environment. Research initiatives facilitate interactions with the external world. Furthermore, by engaging in research, professors can keep abreast of the latest advancements in contemporary technologies. I recall that my professor was involved in multiple research initiatives during my college years. He was frequently invited to deliver lectures at other universities. Although despite my university not being highly ranked, he earned recognition through those projects. Such research endeavors act like portals to the wider world.\nIn addition, professors should take full advantage of the research-conducive atmosphere offered by universities. It is quite typical to find cutting-edge laboratories on campus. Moreover, there's nowhere else you'll find so many talented individuals gathered together. As a result, there's no valid reason to deter professors from utilizing these benefits. We are aware that Einstein formulated the theory of general relativity while he was a professor at HU Berlin. Universities significantly enhance the success of professors. \nFinally, conducting research can also elevate teaching quality. Through research projects, professors can bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and the practical world for their students. They can effectively instruct students on applying knowledge in real-life situations. I vividly remember assisting in one of my professor's research projects. By participating, I had the chance to apply textbook theories to real-world experiments. Research projects offer a more effective teaching approach. \nFor these reasons, it is logical to advocate for professors dedicating more time to research.

Although a child with a competitive nature is often driven to pursue goals or tackle challenges independently, there is a risk that children may become overly competitive, hindering their ability to collaborate with others. While competitiveness can lead to success, it may also limit them in various aspects. Take, for instance, a highly competitive individual might struggle with teamwork projects.\nConversely, cooperation is a vital trait for children, whether in school activities or community engagements. A strong cooperative spirit enables children to interact and bond with peers, enhancing their ability to solve problems and achieve goals collaboratively. Ultimately, in society, significant achievements are rarely attained by individuals alone. Consider, for example, well-known singers or movie stars, despite their talent, rely on a team to manage tasks and handle various matters.\nFrom my perspective, while a competitive child tends to have more drive and vision that can lead to success, it is important to note that these traits may not be as beneficial when entering a society or workplace that demands teamwork skills.

Conversely, others express concern over the decline of local languages. Personally, I hold the view that adopting a universal language across the globe is a beneficial shift, contributing to a more harmonious world.\nA reduction in the number of languages enhances our ability to communicate effectively with one another. With globalization, individuals frequently travel for work-related purposes. Consequently, using a common language can alleviate travelers' challenges in everyday tasks such as ordering food or navigating new destinations. Moreover, students seeking education abroad will face less stress since they can easily forge friendships and participate in discussions, which would be difficult in a multilingual world; this facilitates their adaptation to new surroundings. A universal language minimizes misunderstandings between individuals. Additionally, sharing knowledge across various fields like electronics, medicine, and astronomy becomes more straightforward.\nConversely, some individuals are concerned about the dwindling of native languages. These languages form the foundation for the emergence and initial interaction among cultures. They are emblematic of local heritage. As these languages fall out of use, cultural shifts occur correspondingly.

Additionally, parents equip their children with vital social skills and foundational knowledge to help them succeed in life.\nTo begin with, parents impart fundamental lessons that significantly impact their children's entire lives. When children are born, they are unaware of the world around them and learn everything from their parents. Parents patiently explain and simplify complex concepts to help their children grasp and learn effectively. As a result, through their efforts, parents introduce their children to a vibrant and fascinating world of ideas and experiences.\nFurthermore, parents guide their children in developing strong moral character. They ensure their children learn the importance of expressing gratitude and apologizing appropriately. On one side, it is typical for parents to clarify the traits of good and bad individuals. On the other side, they also teach children how to interact respectfully and kindly with others. This might seem straightforward, but this approach can positively shape their children's future and improve their behavior as they navigate the real world.\nLastly, it is evident that parents are the ones who love their children the most and are constantly attentive to their needs.

It is my conviction that reducing the patient load within the healthcare system can allow hospitals and medical centers to operate more efficiently, resulting in improved treatment for existing patients. As a result, the public should be educated and become informed about health concerns so that precautionary steps against illnesses can be implemented instead of merely focusing on treating the growing number of patients.\nThe second rationale for governments to allocate more funds towards illness prevention and health education is the societal well-being. In my view, health is the utmost priority in a person's life, with happiness and welfare stemming from good health. Consequently, the government should ensure that its citizens have access to learning how to avert potential illnesses that could bring hardship to their lives. For instance, the campaign by the Ministry of Health in Turkey targeting youth smoking issues enhanced the well-being of those who ceased smoking and adopted healthier lifestyles post-campaign.\nTo sum up, a larger share of the budget should be dedicated to education and prevention rather than treatment to achieve a more effective healthcare system and higher levels of well-being.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay171", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 195, "to": 313}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 487, "to": 664}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 679, "to": 750}], "label": "Claim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 759, "to": 885}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1035, "to": 1137}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1153, "to": 1297}], "label": "Claim", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1313, "to": 1491}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1504, "to": 1680}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 7}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 2, 5, 7]}

This topic is contentious, yet I firmly believe that pets should be regarded as equals to humans for various reasons.\nTo begin with, pets are companions akin to certain individuals we know. Much like friends, they are consistently present and offer companionship when loneliness strikes. We can converse with them because their attentiveness often surpasses that of many people. Let me share a personal experience to clarify this. At the age of 14, after the passing of my uncle, I felt as though nothing mattered anymore. Communicating with my friends proved to be discouraging because none of them had ever experienced such feelings. Since I spent considerable time alone at home, my dog stayed by my side, seemingly the only one who truly grasped my profound emotions. Evidently, although pets cannot verbally communicate with us, we can still rely on their presence.\nFurthermore, pets serve a multitude of purposes. For instance, pet therapy has gained significant popularity recently. Studies indicate that pets offer health benefits across numerous conditions. Certain dogs assist visually impaired individuals in navigating urban areas and thus without their help, these individuals would struggle to traverse independently. Additionally, pets are crucial for those battling depression because their presence can significantly uplift their mood.

Governments ought to allocate funds for the preservation of these elements to maintain the cultural diversity that enriches our world. Furthermore, it represents a source of national pride due to the vast cultural heritage, which can instill a greater love for the country among its citizens.\nConversely, there are certain disadvantages associated with preserving minority languages. Although even if governments invest in this endeavor, achieving positive outcomes can be challenging.

Yet, while most people are caught up in this rapid pace, there are those who choose to slow down and savor life more deliberately. To fully understand the situation, it's essential to weigh both the benefits and drawbacks of this increased speed and contemplate which lifestyle is preferable. Personally, embracing a slower lifestyle is crucial, because a rushed existence carries numerous drawbacks.\nTo begin with, leading a fast-paced life is highly stressful and can negatively impact health. Constant rush without taking breaks leads to physical reactions to stress. A significant number of dedicated workers suffer from conditions like burnout, because their bodies can't sustain the demanding pace. For example, my father experienced a breakdown years ago due to his high-pressure job. After taking several weeks off, his health improved, and now he's thriving with a slower lifestyle.\nMoreover, slowing down in life enhances happiness. Excessive stress prevents you from attending to your loved ones. Not rushing allows more time for family and friends. Investing in social connections boosts happiness and lowers stress. For instance, a friend of mine follows a slow-paced lifestyle and is very content, because he cherishes time with his family and nurtures friendships.\nFurthermore, good quality requires time. Rushing through complex tasks often leads to careless errors. Completing tasks hastily can result in overlooking important details or opportunities. Consequently, mistakes are likely to occur which could be avoided with greater patience.

{"id": "id_415", "input": "Over the past ten years, there has been a surge in tourists traveling to witness natural wonders, ancient heritage sites, and diverse cultures globally. Although some may argue that this global tourism negatively impacts the host nations, I assert that it has played a role in boosting economic growth while preserving the cultural and environmental aspects of the tourist destinations. \nTo begin with, global tourism enhances various facets of the host country's economy to cater to the diverse needs of travelers. Consider Cambodia, where numerous tourists visiting the Angkor Wat ancient temple require services such as dining establishments, accommodation, souvenir shops, and other outlets. These needs stimulate related businesses in the vicinity, thereby generating employment for locals and improving infrastructure and living standards. Consequently, tourism has undoubtedly enhanced the quality of life in the host nation.\nMoreover, the tourism sector has aided in the conservation of cultural values and the protection of natural habitats. For example, In Vietnam, cultural attire and natural attractions, such as the 'Trong Dong' drum performance and 'Ha Long' Bay, receive encouragement and financial support from the tourism ministry. Absent this backing and revenue from tourism, many traditional cultures might vanish due to their low-income nature.

{"id": "id_416", "input": "In today's world, a growing number of individuals are opting for ready-made meals as part of their daily diet because it offers a significant time-saving advantage, which is equated to money in today's fast-paced society. Nevertheless, it is evident that consuming prepared meals can have adverse effects due to the use of synthetic additives, neglect of nutritional value, and alteration of dietary habits. In this essay, I aim to elaborate on why this trend is not beneficial, drawing on the three aforementioned reasons.\nTo begin with, to enhance the convenience and flavor of their products, nearly every manufacturer incorporates a variety of artificial additives into the food that is widely bought by consumers. Certain these added substances have led to serious repercussions. For example, there are often articles published in newspapers and magazines that highlight the connection between specific chemical components in certain foods and illnesses. Therefore, convenience foods can sometimes pose health risks to humans.\nNeglecting to prepare fresh meals can result in nutritional deficiencies. While it is indeed true that preparing ready-made meals requires significantly less time than cooking fresh food, However, some studies have clearly shown that ready-made meals fail to provide the essential nutrients required, particularly for children who are in their developmental stages.\nMoreover, culinary arts are a significant human creation. The more we rely on processed meals, the more we diminish our cooking abilities. With the quickening pace of life, most people resort to using microwaves as their sole cooking appliance, allowing them to prepare meals within minutes. However, few individuals recognize that this shift has altered cooking traditions, potentially eroding our culinary customs and cultural heritage.\nIn summary, even though the development of ready-made meals undoubtedly meets the needs of those who are preoccupied with their work commitments, it is not a beneficial trend. Cooking should not be seen as a waste of time; on the contrary, it plays a vital role in maintaining our health and cultural heritage.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay026", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 118, "to": 220}], "label": "Claim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 236, "to": 406}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 539, "to": 717}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 727, "to": 783}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 798, "to": 958}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 971, "to": 1030}], "label": "Claim", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1032, "to": 1104}], "label": "Claim", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1220, "to": 1396}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1456, "to": 1535}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1537, "to": 1688}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1699, "to": 1835}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1861, "to": 1981}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1983, "to": 2011}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 12}], "edges": [{"source": 3, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12]}
{"id": "id_417", "input": "Regarding the debate on whether classmates or colleagues should collaborate on projects face-to-face or via email, I firmly believe that working in person is preferable as it facilitates effective communication. \nTo begin with, team members may hold diverse opinions and must efficiently reach a unified consensus. It is evident that face-to-face discussions in meetings are significantly superior to email exchanges. An experiment at Beijing University involved two groups discussing an activity's budget. The first group engaged in face-to-face discussions, whereas the second group communicated via email. The findings indicate that the first group reached a budget agreement in 30 minutes, whereas the latter group took 30 hours. Similar experiments by other researchers corroborate that face-to-face communication leads to quicker consensus. \nMoreover, working face-to-face can indirectly enhance both project quality and efficiency because it reduces the likelihood of conflicts or disputes among team members. Drafting an email for informal issues tends to make them appear official, thus recipients might feel uneasy or potentially offended by the written words. Although if the same expressions are conveyed verbally, the recipient tends to be more at ease since their responses aren't recorded, preventing misinterpretations of informal discussions as formal assertions. Consequently, fewer misunderstandings result in reduced conflicts and better communication among team members. \nCertainly, there are instances where emails are necessary if team members are spread across different locations. Despite the fact that emails may not be ideal but are preferable to having no communication. Given that in classroom or campus projects, it's rare for team members to be in different regions. \nConversely, we must acknowledge that projects require extensive coordination; relying solely on email for communication could result in overwhelming amounts of correspondence, which is far from ideal. In summary, I advocate for project members to collaborate in person rather than through email due to the fact that face-to-face collaboration is more efficient.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay293", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 137, "to": 168}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 175, "to": 210}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 228, "to": 313}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 334, "to": 416}], "label": "Claim", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 418, "to": 505}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 507, "to": 607}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 636, "to": 732}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 734, "to": 845}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 858, "to": 937}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 946, "to": 1015}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1017, "to": 1089}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1096, "to": 1169}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1180, "to": 1265}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1272, "to": 1379}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1395, "to": 1490}], "label": "Claim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1504, "to": 1604}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1628, "to": 1697}], "label": "Claim", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1710, "to": 1796}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1811, "to": 1998}], "label": "Claim", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2012, "to": 2093}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2115, "to": 2159}], "label": "Claim", "id": 20}], "edges": [{"source": 3, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 16, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 16, "target": 17, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 1, 3, 14, 16, 18, 19, 20]}

The reality is that hazardous bacteria and germs in polluted water can infiltrate human bodies and cause serious ailments, potentially leading to death if not treated promptly. \nFurthermore, it is probable that many food items in large cities are unsafe for consumption. Recent studies indicate that toxic foods are widely available in today's marketplaces. Additionally, overcrowding may exacerbate the spread of contagious diseases, such as coughing, sneezing, and illness. Moreover, residing in these cities also implies living in areas with high crime rates. Unemployed individuals or those who have dropped out of school may easily resort to criminal activities ranging from minor offenses to serious crimes such as theft, pickpocketing, fraud, vandalism, smuggling, or even murder.

{"id": "id_419", "input": "Modern society thrives on intense competition. While some argue that instilling a co-operative mindset in children is crucial, others believe that fostering competitiveness is the key to success. Nonetheless, adopting a co-operative attitude helps children grow into responsible adults with strong ethical values and a supportive social network.\nCo-operation is fundamental for effective teamwork Additionally, Educational institutions prioritize fostering co-operative attitudes in children. Furthermore, Living in a community means mutual support and sharing are vital for success, as No individual can acquire every skill or achieve everything alone. For example, Lions successfully hunt by working as a team and Their teamwork makes capturing prey more efficient and less challenging. Similarly, Adopting a co-operative approach leads to greater efficiency, conserving time and energy, and boosting success rates.\nAt the same time, Co-operation fosters understanding of others' viewpoints and learning from their mistakes, as It helps individuals recognize their strengths and weaknesses compared to others and A co-operative attitude can inspire and motivate by observing others' accomplishments. On the other hand, Competition holds equal significance alongside co-operation.\nRegrettably, the concept of competition has often been distorted. One should strive to surpass their own limits rather than focus on defeating others. Moreover, Competition has played a critical role in advancing science and technology, and Competition drives progress and development. For instance, Automakers continually design newer cars that outperform existing models, which ensures Such competition provides consumers with a wider range of choices.\nHowever, Unethical and excessive competition can have harmful consequences, as The mindset of 'your loss is my gain' does not yield lasting benefits. Competition should always be centered on self-improvement, and Healthy competition focuses on elevating one's own abilities, surpassing others in a constructive manner.\nIn conclusion, co-operation and competition are interdependent and inseparable, akin to two faces of the same coin. I strongly advocate that Children should be nurtured with a balance of co-operation and healthy competition. Beyond this, children must understand the pitfalls of selfish competition.

The wellspring of creativity lies within an uninhibited mind. Therefore, creative individuals in the arts should be allowed to express their thoughts freely without constraints.\nThroughout history, creators like Michaelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, and Shakespeare have crafted works that convey significant social messages. From sculptures to paintings, literature to theater and cinema, these creative outputs have mirrored the societal challenges of their times. Artistic creations contribute to raising social awareness through the delivery of social messages.\nNonetheless, Innovative creations encourage individuals to reflect peacefully and examine their own conscience. Such works aid in highlighting issues and criticizing government misconduct. For example, Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasrin faced accusations of opposing the government simply for addressing a social concern. This kind of stance poses an obstacle to nurturing creative talents. Additionally, Creativity also offers an aesthetic allure.\nRegrettably, numerous governments impose restrictions on artists.

I am convinced that reducing patient numbers within the health system can allow hospitals and healthcare facilities to operate more efficiently, leading to improved care for existing patients. Consequently, it is crucial for society to be educated and become aware of health concerns so that preventative measures against illnesses can be implemented instead of focusing solely on treating a growing number of patients.\nAnother reason why governments must increase funding for illness prevention and health education as it is central to societal welfare. From my perspective, there is nothing as vital as health in a person's life, as happiness and well-being stem from being healthy. Thus, a government should facilitate ways for its citizens to learn how to guard against potential illnesses that could bring suffering into their lives. For instance, the Ministry of Health's campaign in Turkey aimed at addressing the smoking issue among youth improved the well-being of those who quit smoking and adopted healthier lifestyles following the initiative.\nIn summary, a larger share of the budget should be dedicated to education and prevention rather than treatment to attain a more effective health system and higher levels of well-being.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay400", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 181, "to": 295}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 297, "to": 423}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 445, "to": 616}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 632, "to": 708}], "label": "Claim", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 717, "to": 843}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 864, "to": 978}], "label": "Claim", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1001, "to": 1108}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1116, "to": 1262}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1278, "to": 1479}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1493, "to": 1664}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 9}], "edges": [{"source": 3, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 3, 5, 9]}

In this essay, I will explore this issue from two perspectives.\nFirstly, it is widely acknowledged that animals are both companions and crucial to human survival, since without animals, the natural balance would collapse, leading to human extinction. Animal testing accelerates the extinction of certain animal species. In other words, conducting these tests poses a risk to humanity's future and the next generation.\nAlthough animal testing disrupts natural equilibrium, it is essential to ensure that people can enjoy long lives.

Such content significantly affects individuals going through adolescence. For instance, an online cartoon comedy called Happy Tree is exceedingly violent, featuring characters frequently having their heads or limbs torn off. Another compelling reason is that television networks occasionally broadcast foreign shows, potentially leading audiences to embrace ideas that might not align with local cultural values. A few years back, there was a Japanese game show that involved hurling cream cakes at the losing contestant. This practice is notably detrimental to the environment.\nThe primary counterargument revolves around safeguarding the public. Specifically, the government should ensure timely communication of information to the media, particularly during disasters and disease outbreaks. For example, during the SARS outbreak in 2003, the Chinese government restricted public access to information, resulting in numerous casualties. Despite this, another viewpoint is to keep the public from experiencing unnecessary panic and disorder.\nBoth sides of the debate present valid points.

Unsurprisingly, this intense focus on famous individuals raises concerns among many, particularly regarding its impact on children. This essay will explore both the negative and positive outcomes of this influence on young minds.\nBeing famous comes with significant responsibilities for public figures, as their fans are highly sensitive to their actions. Celebrity scandals and gossip spread rapidly among the public, who often react negatively. This indicates that celebrities who attract attention due to drug or alcohol abuse are likely to face public shame. Consequently, youngsters may understand that such conduct is unacceptable.\nConversely, excessive media coverage of celebrities appears to negatively affect children's career choices.

A positive case in point is Queens Center Mall in Queens, New York City, offers a diverse range of stores, products, and services, from fashion to electronics and dining, catering to consumer preferences. Many people believe that it ranks among the most successful malls in New York. During my visit, I discovered that I found nearly every brand or retail outlet available, including Macy's and JCPenney, during my visit. Personally, I think a large shopping mall serves as a destination for residents to enjoy during their free time.\nMoreover, it not only serves as a shopping venue but also generates employment opportunities. opening new stores in the mall could lead to numerous job openings. it presents a chance for individuals seeking either part-time or full-time employment. students and retirees might work there to fill their spare time while earning money.\nFinally, we are more likely to purchase items at a lower cost at the shopping center, simultaneously saving time. competition may arise between the new shopping center and existing stores to attract customers. Consequently, promotional sales make it easier for consumers to compare prices for the same products before purchasing. Additionally, residents won't face commuting issues, given the proximity of the shopping center to their homes.\nFor these reasons, I endorse the development of a large shopping center in my area, as it will benefit our community.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay178", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 20, "to": 94}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 138, "to": 238}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 268, "to": 443}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 470, "to": 522}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 559, "to": 660}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 682, "to": 773}], "label": "Claim", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 785, "to": 867}], "label": "Claim", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 869, "to": 935}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 937, "to": 1022}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1024, "to": 1107}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1118, "to": 1221}], "label": "Claim", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1223, "to": 1317}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1333, "to": 1437}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1453, "to": 1549}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1570, "to": 1667}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 14}], "edges": [{"source": 5, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 5, 6, 10, 14]}

{"id": "id_435", "input": "Over the past ten years, the workload for university students has steadily risen. Some argue that students shouldn't be allowed to attend classes until they have passed their exams. Others believe that students should be able to participate in university courses without the prerequisite of exam success. In my view, students have the potential to gain university knowledge without needing to pass exams beforehand. The reasons for this perspective are as follows. \nFirstly, students aren't consistently proficient in every aspect of a subject. For instance, I have a passion for Physics. However, electronics is not my favorite area because electronics is not always visible in everyday life. Moreover, my score in physics dropped to zero when studying electronics. Yet, I consistently score 100 in other physics areas. If I were barred from classes until I passed the electronics exam, I would repeatedly fail the entire physics course. Fortunately, at our university, class attendance isn't restricted by exam scores. Thus, I can continue studying physics without worrying about my electronics grade. Eventually, I revisited electronics and passed the exam.\nSecondly, if universities implement a policy requiring exam success before class attendance, students are likely to become underdeveloped. Failing most exams means missing out on most classes. Consequently, students would have nothing to engage with on campus. Consequently, They might resort to playing online games day and night. This would lead to a decline in academic performance. Ultimately, Such students might end up feeling like failures in society. And all this stems from the university's refusal to let them attend classes. This isn't just a failure of the university but of the entire educational system.\nAdmittedly, university students may not achieve high standards if allowed to attend classes regardless of exam results. Yet, the advantage of open class access outweighs the concern of lower scores.\nIn conclusion, universities should permit students to attend classes without having to pass tests first because this approach acknowledges that not every student excels in every subject area and prevents students from being left undeveloped on campus.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay311", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 317, "to": 414}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 475, "to": 543}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 598, "to": 633}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 642, "to": 692}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 694, "to": 765}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 767, "to": 819}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 821, "to": 937}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 939, "to": 1019}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1021, "to": 1102}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1104, "to": 1159}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1171, "to": 1298}], "label": "Claim", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1300, "to": 1352}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1354, "to": 1420}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1436, "to": 1491}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1493, "to": 1545}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1559, "to": 1618}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1620, "to": 1695}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1697, "to": 1777}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1791, "to": 1897}], "label": "Claim", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1904, "to": 1976}], "label": "Premise", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1993, "to": 2081}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 20}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2090, "to": 2228}], "label": "Claim", "id": 21}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 19, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 1, 10, 18, 20, 21]}

While the impact of criminals on society, particularly on the victims, is profoundly harmful, they remain human, and their lives should be respected.

Additionally, from a punitive perspective, enduring a bleak, isolated, guilt-ridden existence is more tormenting than immediate execution.\nAnother significant reason to abolish the death penalty is the potential for wrongful convictions of innocent individuals. juries, being human, can lack sound judgment.

However, there are individuals who argue that this viewpoint overlooks the ecological and environmental harm caused by tourist activities, along with the negative impacts on local communities and ecosystems. While both perspectives have merit, I believe that with effective management and regulation, a thriving tourism sector offers substantial economic growth and prosperity for both rural and urban areas.\nOne of the most evident advantages is that tourism can significantly enhance economic growth in a specific state or region. This occurs not only through direct spending by tourists, but also by generating direct and indirect employment opportunities within the community, including retail, agriculture, and service sectors. The increase in taxes and the development of local markets for accommodation and luxury items, among others, stem from robust and well-controlled tourism initiatives. Furthermore, tourism creates a significant number of direct and indirect jobs for the community in areas such as retail, hospitality, transportation, agriculture, and services. The rise in employment opportunities enables more individuals to contribute meaningfully to society by purchasing goods with their increasing incomes. Consequently, this invigorates the economic cycle, thereby fostering local economic prosperity.\nSome individuals may argue against this, pointing out the environmental and cultural damage tourism can cause. Indeed, in comparison, industries like resource extraction and manufacturing cause far greater destruction than tourism. For example, paper mills discharge massive quantities of pollutants into rivers, significantly contaminating water sources. Conversely, most tourists, particularly those who invest considerable time and money in finding and visiting remote villages, are well-educated. It is unreasonable to think that these sensible individuals would not behave responsibly when required.\nUpon thoroughly evaluating both sides of the debate, the tourism industry is appealing due to its vital socioeconomic benefits.

{"id": "id_438", "input": "Over the centuries, the human population has steadily increased, and now, for the first time ever, it surpasses seven billion. Consequently, more and more of the natural world has been sacrificed to accommodate housing, agriculture, and industry. However, isn't it crucial to safeguard the land to ensure the survival of other species sharing our planet? In my view, we must undeniably alter our perspective on environmental matters for multiple reasons.\nFirstly, preserving natural diversity is vital for future generations. Without altering our actions, we risk driving countless species that have existed for millennia to extinction. By dismantling natural habitats\u2014such as forests, jungles, and lakes\u2014to make room for industry and agriculture, we are depriving the ecosystem. For instance, a substantial portion of the South American rainforest is cleared daily to supply timber and farmland. Failing to conserve this critical part of our ecosystem will result in endangered species losing their habitats and facing extinction. Consequently, future generations will miss the chance to observe and learn about these animals.\nMoreover, maintaining a balanced and sustainable environment is crucial for weather patterns. Our actions lead to pollution, which significantly impacts Earth's weather patterns and contributes to the undeniable phenomenon of Global Warming.

Additionally, to thrive in the labor market, students need not only technical skills but also soft skills like teamwork and presentation. For example, participating in sports helps students grasp team spirit and acquire teamwork skills. Consequently, these subjects can enhance students' capabilities.

Some assert that traditional print media will soon become obsolete due to the rise in digital media consumption. However, others believe they will persist. I concur with the viewpoint that newspapers and magazines are destined to become relics over time. I will substantiate my position by examining how the internet delivers current news swiftly and provides easy access to historical reports.\nMedia holds a crucial duty to disseminate current events promptly, especially during crises. This enables readers to stay informed and react appropriately. For instance, when the MH 370 aircraft vanished, everyone was eager to learn about this heartbreaking event. The relatives of those onboard were anxious to uncover the truth. In such scenarios, newspapers and magazines cannot match the promptness of digital media. Instead of waiting for the next print, individuals can acquire credible updates on current events via the internet within hours. This clarifies why digital media is poised to dominate over traditional print.\nIndividuals frequently seek out historical news for various purposes, such as research or personal interest. For instance, a researcher might wish to explore the post-World War II plight of a small Japanese village named Oramaki. Obtaining such historical data from newspapers and magazines is challenging unless one knows exactly where to look. But the internet offers robust search capabilities, allowing users to find topics and extract details effortlessly. This advantageous feature of digital media is absent in newspapers and magazines.\nIn conclusion, the rapid-response digital media, rich with information, will supplant newspapers and magazines as the primary source of news for legitimate reasons.

While there are some arguments about the potential negative impacts, I firmly believe that the positive aspects significantly outweigh the downsides. This essay will thoroughly discuss several advantages associated with this issue.\nIt is clear that students can acquire practical experience by engaging in extra jobs. Part-time employment provides them with valuable opportunities to apply what they are learning at their universities. Furthermore, which seems increasingly crucial given the current lack of adequate practical resources available in universities. Consequently, students with part-time jobs gain not only academic understanding but also practical experience. Additionally, having work experience during their student years provides a significant edge when applying for jobs after graduation.\nSecondly, students who work part-time tend to be more self-assured and independent compared to their peers. Through regular communication with colleagues in a company setting where they can express new ideas freely, students can greatly enhance their confidence. Moreover, the working environment demands independent thinking, working, and problem-solving skills, which are incredibly beneficial when these traits are applied to academic challenges.\nFinally, taking on additional jobs assists students financially with their living expenses. Indeed, the high cost of tuition, coupled with increasing living expenses, is becoming a significant burden for students. Although the income from these jobs is generally modest, it can help alleviate some of these financial pressures. Besides, this helps prevent students from depending on their families and prepares them for a self-sufficient future.\nTo sum up, I am confident that holding a part-time job during university years offers students several distinct advantages.

I contend that a reduced salary would be more fitting when compared to individuals in scientific, social, or economic domains.\nTo begin with, there is an argument that athletes and singers are worthy of their current pay due to they possess remarkable talents that are not common among the general populace. For instance, few can match the basketball prowess of Michael Jordan, a former American player renowned for multiple NBA championships. Additionally, these individuals endure rigorous and persistent training, plus participate in numerous competitions to gain recognition and prove their worth. Furthermore, even though despite the large number of singers and athletes, only a small fraction achieve fame and success. By overcoming these challenges, they deserve substantial compensation for their outstanding efforts. \nYet, their abilities should not be excessively valued. Others argue that singers and athletes actually contribute minimally to societal advancement. Their impressive performances are valued primarily in terms of aesthetics and entertainment. While scientists innovate devices for everyday use, doctors treat and heal patients, and police officers maintain national security and order, singers and athletes do not significantly enhance the material quality of life. Their role is to foster relaxation and enjoyment among audiences. Indeed, though their contribution is necessary, it is less vital than those made by healthcare professionals or scientists. Consequently, their high salaries seem unjustifiable when key workers receive modest pay that barely covers essential expenses.\nConsidering all the insights provided above, the earnings of professional athletes and singers are disproportionate to the societal value they provide.

For instance, city monuments not only depict the history and culture of the city but also enhance its beauty, making it a desirable destination for visitors. Indeed, tourism serves as a primary income source for some nations, hence, governments should support the arts because artistic creations are vital for stimulating the tourism sector.\nMoreover, artworks in museums and galleries typically capture the essence of cultural and historical evolution. Thus, art plays a crucial role in preserving and safeguarding a nation's culture and history. young individuals can gain deeper insights into their nation's cultural and historical heritage through observing diverse artworks.\nA further reason for assisting artists is that artistic talent is invaluable and should not be overlooked. In fact, few people possess the gift of creating art and crafts.

Initially, considering the evidence, women have demonstrated their capabilities in both indoor and outdoor arenas. For instance, today's women are excelling both at home and in aviation.

Consequently, universities align their offerings with employer needs, tailoring courses to specific genders.\nIn summary, I firmly assert that universities should allow individuals to freely choose their subjects.

Some argue that attending classes should be mandatory, while others feel it should be left to the students' discretion. In my view, since university-level education imparts sufficient maturity for students to make their own choices. Consequently, I firmly believe that students should have the option to attend classes at their discretion.\nFirstly, attending classes can sometimes be an inefficient use of time. For example, certain lecturers simply recite passages from textbooks related to the course module. Furthermore, they fail to elucidate the content in a manner that enhances student comprehension. this results in a futile expenditure of time. Given that students at universities are mature adults, they possess the capability to independently read and grasp textbook material. Additionally, thanks to modern technology, students can access a wealth of information from diverse sources. For instance, students can explore numerous articles, e-books, and video tutorials online that offer clearer insights. On the other hand, some lecturers present their material in a highly engaging and informative manner. students find such lectures valuable and feel their time is well-spent.\nMoreover, universities often allocate entire days for lectures. Also, many university students work alongside their studies to cover educational expenses. students need to engage in part-time work. Thus, they must balance their schedule between lectures, study time, and work commitments. Simultaneously, instead of attending dull lectures, students can participate in activities like debates, swimming, or basketball. This way these activities allow them to connect with peers from other universities and foster relationships. \nIn summary, although a few exceptional lecturers offer highly informative sessions, others bore students and squander their time. university students are mature both mentally and physically. they possess the wisdom to determine their own priorities.

{"id": "id_450", "input": "Deciding the right age for retirement is a topic of significant debate in society. Some believe individuals should have the freedom to choose when to retire, while others disagree. From my perspective, the ideal retirement age should be approximately 60 years. Personally, I firmly believe a specific age should be determined for retirement at the age mentioned for various reasons, which I will elaborate on below.\nTo begin with, if older employees continue to dominate the workforce, there will be fewer job opportunities for recent graduates. Consequently, many will be compelled to pursue careers vastly different from their field of study. To further illustrate, a medical graduate may feel quite disheartened after dedicating five valuable years to studying medicine only to end up in a different profession due to limited job prospects. Moreover, lacking genuine enthusiasm for work they didn't choose, their performance at work is likely to decline.\nIn addition, not all older employees are in good physical health. Beyond a certain age, many are at increased risk for numerous health issues such as stress-related ailments and heart conditions. For instance, the stressful life of an elderly teacher will undoubtedly impact his health. As a result, they will struggle to deliver their best performance in their roles. Furthermore, the educational institution will bear the cost of his medical expenses, leading to further financial strain. Therefore, it would be advantageous to provide opportunities to the younger generation as individuals grow older.\nIt is important to acknowledge that never underestimate the skills and knowledge of the retired senior workers. Their profound experiences and insights in fields like engineering, medicine, and law can be a great asset to the younger workforce. Therefore, encouraging retirees to visit companies or hospitals for regular interactions with current staff can help bridge gaps and transfer knowledge.\nIn summary, it is clear that setting a retirement age limit is necessary. Eventually, the older generation must pass on responsibilities to the newcomers eager to prove themselves.

In terms of national progress, some argue that high-quality university education is vital for youth, whereas others claim it merely contributes to rising unemployment rates. In this essay, I will examine both perspectives to reach a definitive conclusion.\nTo start, those questioning the practicality of universities present various arguments. They argue that there are plenty of career opportunities for individuals without a university degree, such as in fields like mechanics, sales, or engineering, and additionally, there is a shortage of manual labor among graduates. Moreover, the job market for highly educated individuals is excessively competitive, making it difficult to secure employment after graduation. Consequently, it is detrimental to national productivity when young people spend excessive time seeking high-paying jobs, which can be a wasteful endeavor.\nConversely, those in favor contend that universities offer not just career skills but also valuable academic knowledge in areas like bioscience, politics, and medicine. These academic contributions are essential for global advancement. Furthermore, numerous groundbreaking discoveries and accomplishments in modern society have originated from university research. Universities also play a crucial role in that a wide range of experiences in university life can enhance the capabilities of the younger generation because there are many opportunities through internships, in-depth discussions, independent living, and exchange programs.\nIn conclusion, both arguments regarding the necessity of a university education have valid points, but I align with the latter perspective.

Often, students become addicted to their favorite shows like cartoons or baseball, causing them to lose focus on their studies during exams, which can severely affect their grades. \nTo sum up, I am convinced that the drawbacks of watching TV surpass its advantages, and consequently, allowing students unrestricted access to TV without adequate supervision from parents or teachers would result in more harmful impacts on children.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay361", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 150, "to": 267}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 269, "to": 377}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 407, "to": 466}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 468, "to": 619}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 621, "to": 704}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 720, "to": 936}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 950, "to": 1017}], "label": "Claim", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1032, "to": 1111}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1113, "to": 1214}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1216, "to": 1395}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1429, "to": 1480}], "label": "Claim", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1500, "to": 1646}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 11}], "edges": [{"source": 4, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 4, 6, 10, 11]}

I will begin by examining the benefits for both parties and conclude with my final thoughts.\nInitially, students can acquire invaluable insights during their tenure at the organizations they are designated to. Many educational programs focus predominantly on theoretical knowledge delivered by instructors to students in a classroom setting. Consequently, students often have limited understanding of real-world challenges and conditions they will face upon entering the job market post-graduation. Therefore, although these internships are unpaid, they provide experiences that are invaluable and cannot be purchased.\nFor companies, having unpaid interns undeniably offers financial savings. Furthermore, young interns can contribute fresh ideas as they are not confined by rigid workloads and possess greater creativity, which is particularly beneficial for crafting new advertisements or slogans. Additionally, they have the opportunity to identify potential employees and commence their training. As a result, companies benefit by saving time and resources typically spent on recruiting new staff and conducting orientation programs.\nIn conclusion, students gain practical working experience beyond textbooks and classrooms, which can significantly aid future job prospects, while organizations benefit not only from saving time and money but also from the innovative ideas shared by young minds.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay041", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 265, "to": 369}], "label": "Claim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 371, "to": 501}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 517, "to": 658}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 671, "to": 778}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 780, "to": 852}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 867, "to": 1059}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1075, "to": 1160}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1175, "to": 1297}], "label": "Claim", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1314, "to": 1560}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 8}], "edges": [{"source": 0, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 7, 8]}
{"id": "id_462", "input": "The question of whether individuals should engage in hobbies and physical activities is often debated. People hold varied opinions on this matter. Some argue that focusing on work is more important, but I disagree with them. Engaging in personal hobbies and participating in physical activities offers numerous advantages.\nTo start, pursuing hobbies and engaging in physical activities is the optimal way to maintain fitness. Staring at a computer screen all day can leave us feeling dazed, therefore participating in sports and hobbies can help prevent obesity and vision problems. My neighbor Tom used to work as a computer engineer at a large corporation. He consumed fast food daily and never exercised. Upon realizing his weight was hindering his dating life, he decided to lose weight. He began jogging every morning. A month later, he was slimmer and had found a girlfriend.\nMoreover, doing the same thing for extended periods can become monotonous, engaging in hobbies and sports can rejuvenate our minds. For instance, in schools, students are given breaks after each class to relax and prepare for the next session. Humans aren't machines; continuous work for twenty-four hours is impossible. A brief period of sports or hobbies can recharge our energy.\nFinally, it's important to cultivate at least one personal hobby, not for show, but to express emotions when under stress or feeling down. Playing a musical instrument is beneficial; I play the classical guitar. When facing challenges in studies, I pick up my guitar and play the song Greensleeves. This helps me feel better and boosts my confidence.\nWhile developing personal hobbies might require a significant amount of time, yet doing so leads to a healthier body, a refreshed mind, and provides a means to alleviate stress and sadness.

{"id": "id_463", "input": "Every individual is unique. Even though students undergo the same educational system, their learning capabilities vary. Some students grasp concepts quickly, while others take more time. Therefore, compensating teachers based on student grades is inappropriate and unfair to educators. Consequently, I oppose this idea.\nTo start, in educational institutions, a teacher's primary responsibility is to impart knowledge to students, and this task must be completed within a set timeframe. teachers have a limited period to conduct their lessons. In this brief span, it isn't feasible for teachers to focus on each student individually. Teachers must adhere to the schedule to cover all required topics. Focusing on individual students could delay the curriculum, causing many students to miss essential topics.\nSecondly, students possess varying learning capabilities. It's unrealistic for all students to grasp lessons within the same timeframe. While some students might grasp all topics, others may not. Hence, test results vary among students. These differences are influenced by the amount of effort students put into studying. It's not the teachers' responsibility. Thus, teacher salaries should not be determined by student test results.\nFinally, paying teachers based on student grades could result in significant issues. This poses a threat to the quality of education. Teachers might neglect effective teaching strategies that help students understand the material. Teachers might inflate grades to secure higher salaries. Such issues must be avoided. Consequently, student grades should not be a factor in teacher evaluations.\nIn summary, I completely oppose the idea that teachers' pay should be linked to student learning outcomes because teachers cannot focus on each student individually in a classroom setting.

{"id": "id_464", "input": "Nowadays, everyone is familiar with the term 'globalization', which signifies a closer interconnected world where nations influence each other more profoundly than ever before. This is why both governmental and non-governmental bodies are concentrating on fostering harmony and providing assistance to underprivileged countries. It is undeniable that simply providing aid to disadvantaged nations can be exploited by more powerful countries. Furthermore, substantial amounts of resources and financial aid have led to corruption and political dependency in impoverished nations. Nevertheless, I concur that assisting impoverished countries yields positive outcomes, outweighing any negative consequences for several reasons.\nTo begin with, underprivileged nations grapple with a lack of essential resources and infrastructure to initiate businesses and enhance their wealth. Escaping poverty necessitates supporting fundamental industrial elements like electricity, roads, highways, natural resources, technology, and corporate buildings. Offering assistance can help these nations resolve their economic issues and enable them to operate independently. In reality, South Korea was among the world's poorest countries, even compared to many African nations in the 1960s. It has since transformed into a robust economy, aiding other nations, after receiving a decade of support from abroad.\nSecondly, aid initiatives encourage empathy towards those facing poverty. When individuals in affluent countries consider the hardships faced by those in poverty, they are less likely to take their own prosperity for granted. This not only highlights the importance of harmony and compassion but also serves as an opportunity to embrace the humane principles of globalization.\nThirdly, aid initiatives may encompass tangible advantages. In a globalized world, economies are intricately connected, influencing one another. When the American mortgage system faltered, economies across Europe and Asia experienced fluctuations, with some requiring international support to avert bankruptcy.\nIn summary, the positive impacts of aid are highlighted in three main points: empowering poor countries to strengthen their economies, instilling humane values in societies, and maintaining a robust global economy.

This trend is often used as a marketing strategy to promote films. In my opinion, violence in films adversely impacts young people, particularly affecting their behavior, emotions, and academic performance.\nFirstly, children's behavior is a primary concern for parents, who constantly strive to do their best. Nowadays, children are more engrossed in television programs. Consider a scenario where a child's favorite actor plays violent roles. In such situations, the child might mimic the actor's actions to emulate them. Consequently, surprisingly, the violent behavior influences the child's own actions.\nMeanwhile, humans, especially young ones, are highly impressionable. For example, death is always a disheartening event. Additionally, murder is even more distressing. Therefore, if such scenes appear on television, they are likely to negatively influence viewers, particularly children.\nFinally, beyond all the previously mentioned points, monitoring the education of young individuals is essential. For instance, a child views a terrifying film. Conversely, he must prepare for an exam. In such a scenario, because he is preoccupied with thoughts of the movie and its events, it is clear that he will struggle to focus on his studies effectively. Hence, a young person's education could be severely compromised.\nIn conclusion, I can confidently assert that the rise of violence in movies undoubtedly has negative repercussions on young people, especially affecting their academics, feelings, and conduct.

It is doubtful, however, that this truly aligns with the demands of potential employers, as modern universities have transformed into realms of specialists: areas where more knowledge is accumulated about increasingly narrower subjects. Yet, amidst the wide array of options available, there are often several courses that directly relate to job-seeking and other everyday life aspects. While I appreciate the universities' initiative to offer such courses to cultivate skills necessary for employment and support their mission, I do not consider this the primary or optimal function of a university.\nA university is generally perceived as a conduit for disseminating or granting access to knowledge. By this, I mean that students are the primary focus for universities, not the employers, as students are the ones who come in search of knowledge. High school graduates opt to continue their education in universities for various reasons: to earn a more widely recognized degree, to gain industry knowledge and insights, or simply to delve deeper into research interests in a specific field.\nConversely, universities are seen as hubs where plentiful educational resources are amassed. Therefore, it is not imperative for a university to offer a specific course or type of training, but rather, these should be accessible as needed.

Some argue that zoos offer significant entertainment and ecological benefits, while others contend that confining animals is inherently unethical. Both perspectives will be explored before arriving at a balanced conclusion.\nTo begin with, opponents of zoos assert that it is unethical to confine animals in captivity as animals deserve to be recognized as non-human individuals with the right to live freely. Removing them from their natural habitats and placing them in restricted enclosures is deeply unjust. Moreover, a large number of zoos, particularly in less developed nations, fail to provide the necessary care and attention that animals need. Animals in such places often suffer from malnutrition and lack access to adequate medical care. Beyond this, In some cases, animals native to hot climates are forced to endure freezing winters in regions like Europe.\nConversely, proponents argue that zoos offer entertainment to the public and contribute to ecological balance. Visiting zoos is an enjoyable experience for many, especially children, who delight in seeing their favorite animals, newborn offspring, and exotic species from around the globe. Zoos serve as an educational resource, teaching the public about the lives and behaviors of various animals. Furthermore, Zoos play a vital role in preserving endangered species and preventing their extinction. This is because animals in zoos are kept in enclosures designed to mimic their natural habitats, and endangered species are shielded from predators and poachers. Consequently, zoos are essential for maintaining ecological equilibrium.\nIn summary, both sides present compelling arguments, but from my perspective, zoos bring more benefits than drawbacks.

I personally favor working for a large organization for a variety of reasons.\nTo begin with, securing a job with a large company is significantly easier than with a smaller one. Large organizations are consistently on the lookout for skilled professionals to meet their needs in areas such as distribution, management, and the sale of their products across various countries. For instance, when a large company establishes a branch in a different country, it creates a demand for more employees to staff that location. Put simply, A larger organization equates to greater employment opportunities.\nAdditionally, I believe that large companies are typically able to offer higher salaries compared to smaller ones. The very fact that a company is large indicates its substantial success. This implies that this success translates into the ability to pay their employees higher wages. For example, it stands to reason that a well-known, globally recognized company would offer salaries that exceed those of a small, local business.\nFurthermore, I have a passion for traveling across the globe. large organizations boast international renown, often organizing global conferences, meetings, and workshops, which provide me with opportunities to travel to different countries and connect with new people. These events also allow me to acquire new skills relevant to my field.\nIn summary, I can confidently assert that I would much rather work for a large company than a small one.

{"id": "id_470", "input": "The debate surrounds whether university students should be required to attend classes. This is a compelling question as it impacts countless students globally. Despite this, universities adopt varying policies on the matter. A key consideration might be whether the goal is to maximize the knowledge gained or to enhance the breadth of meaningful experiences for students. Personally, students should have the freedom to decide whether to attend classes because it enhances students' quality of life, boosts their motivation to learn, and equips them with essential life skills.\nTo begin with, adopting a more flexible policy is highly practical. Enforcing attendance requires extensive administrative effort. Particularly in large lecture halls, monitoring individual attendance is impractical. Thus, allowing optional attendance eliminates unnecessary bureaucracy, saving time and resources.\nIn addition, some students may find independent learning at home, such as studying textbooks, more effective. This is particularly relevant when the lecturer lacks enthusiasm or engagement. Allowing students to skip classes provides them with an option to avoid ineffective teaching. Consequently, this way, they can dedicate their time to self-study and focus on mastering the course content independently.\nFurthermore, having the option to skip classes increases flexibility, thereby enhancing the overall quality of student life. Sometimes a lively party on Thursday night is worth extending, rather than cutting short for a Friday morning lecture. A flexible attendance policy allows students to shift their study time to later in the day, fostering a sense of autonomy and improving time management efficiency. Studies indicate that greater satisfaction with aspects of university life correlates with better academic performance.\nLastly, psychological studies distinguish between two types of motivation: intrinsic motivation, which stems from an individual's internal mindset, and extrinsic motivation, which arises from external validation such as praise. Intrinsic motivation is widely regarded as more beneficial because it promotes deeper learning and better mental health. On the other hand, to develop intrinsic motivation, students must become conscious of their personal strengths and goals. Allowing students to decide whether to attend classes encourages them to reflect on their academic choices and fosters self-driven motivation. These reflective and motivational skills are invaluable not only during their education but throughout their lifetime.\nIn summary, it is evident that class attendance should be left as a choice for students. This perspective is grounded in the belief that it improves students' immediate experiences and provides them with lifelong skills and knowledge.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay205", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 385, "to": 453}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 462, "to": 577}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 907, "to": 1002}], "label": "Claim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1004, "to": 1082}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1084, "to": 1176}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1192, "to": 1300}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1315, "to": 1425}], "label": "Claim", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1427, "to": 1544}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1546, "to": 1708}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1710, "to": 1828}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2058, "to": 2177}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2198, "to": 2299}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2301, "to": 2442}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2444, "to": 2561}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2575, "to": 2650}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2652, "to": 2796}], "label": "Claim", "id": 15}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 6, 12, 14, 15]}
{"id": "id_471", "input": "Today, transportation has become a significant social issue. The debate over whether governments should allocate more funds to traffic infrastructure or prioritize the enhancement of public transportation remains ongoing. It's reasonable to propose that governments should invest more in buses, trains, and subway systems. These public transport options cater to a vast number of people within the community, thus they contribute to reducing traffic congestion and cutting down carbon emissions. Both aspects hold substantial importance.\nAbove all, lowering carbon emissions is crucial for safeguarding the atmosphere. The reality is that the increase in cars and motorbikes on the roads exacerbates damage to the ozone layer. An investment in road improvement is likely to encourage more people to use their personal vehicles for commuting. This inevitably results in higher carbon emissions, potentially leading to skin cancer and environmental degradation. On the other hand, with better buses, trains, or subways available, individuals are more likely to opt for public transport, thereby lowering carbon emissions. Clearly, focusing financial resources on public transport development yields positive effects on the planet. \nFurthermore, this policy is integral in mitigating traffic congestion. Traffic jams are undeniably a major issue in numerous metropolitan areas. The primary reason behind this issue is that a large number of vehicles are constantly moving on the streets. To address the problem effectively, governments need to shift public focus towards public transport to lessen the use of cars and motorbikes. Enhancing roads and highways doesn't seem to address the root cause of traffic congestion.\nIn summary, I acknowledge that well-maintained roads and highways facilitate easier travel.

Tourism contributes to increased pollution and waste, such as higher greenhouse gas emissions, discarded waste, and excessive consumption of water, energy, and electricity in luxury accommodations. Considering these points, it appears that tourism places significant strain on ecosystems and local resources, suggesting it should not be promoted.\nOn the other hand, a thriving tourism sector can greatly benefit local economies. Tourists traveling abroad spend not only on entrance fees to attractions but also on food, lodging, transportation, and entertainment. These expenditures allow local governments and residents to generate substantial income while also creating more job opportunities.

For example, I embarked on reading a novel last week. I lack the time to finish a novel in a single day, so I typically read it on my way home from English class. In contrast, I can't manage to watch an entire film because I can only sit in front of the TV for 15 minutes before needing to study.\nSome may argue that watching TV is enjoyable for many people when they realize they can acquire various skills, such as learning a new language, by watching films. This argument holds some validity initially; however, films are not an ideal choice for language learning, especially for beginners since characters in films speak rapidly and unclearly, posing challenges for language learners. For these learners, starting with novels is preferable as they are more understandable and enjoyable.\nIn conclusion, reading fiction is more delightful because these books offer greater depth, are far more accessible, and are more beneficial for language learners.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay150", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 101, "to": 159}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 196, "to": 252}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 262, "to": 355}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 357, "to": 508}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 524, "to": 661}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 682, "to": 751}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 763, "to": 805}], "label": "Claim", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 807, "to": 892}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 894, "to": 1003}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1018, "to": 1057}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1059, "to": 1166}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1181, "to": 1219}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1228, "to": 1300}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1322, "to": 1362}], "label": "Claim", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1381, "to": 1464}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1520, "to": 1597}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1604, "to": 1692}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1694, "to": 1794}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1811, "to": 1845}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1854, "to": 1957}], "label": "Claim", "id": 19}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 13, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 13, "target": 15, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 15, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 6, 13, 18, 19]}

Similarly, animals like horses, cattle, and donkeys are employed for agriculture, farming, and transportation. Many individuals keep pets like dogs and cats, training them as service dogs and scent dogs, which are invaluable to law enforcement and even assist the visually impaired.

Moreover, countless animals endure severe suffering or death due to scientific experiments for drugs and various products. Cage farming is another example, which violates animal rights. Other practices include equestrian sports, where horses are forced to run long distances and are whipped to increase their speed.

In addition to real-time news, there are numerous programs with educational intentions. Children can gain a wealth of knowledge if they engage with these shows thoughtfully. For instance, in Korea, there's a channel known as EBS. It caters to audiences ranging from children to teenagers. Through EBS lectures, various subjects can be studied. Additionally, Numerous documentaries, such as those detailing the lives of notable figures in Korea, are available. Utilizing these educational programs can inspire individuals rather than lead to adverse effects. \nMoreover, Television serves as a tool for stress relief. Numerous TV shows, such as sports broadcasts, exist. Nowadays, children are experiencing significant stress, as They face immense pressure concerning their studies. Watching sports programs makes it easy for them to alleviate stress. For example, I was overwhelmed with stress from school. Consequently, I became quite irritable, albeit. Watching the soccer match between Korea and Japan erased my stress. Conversely, This soccer match enabled me to pursue my academic endeavors, because It was effective in easing my stress.\nTo summarize, certainly, television can air violent content, but when children wisely choose TV shows, the benefits outweigh the downsides.

It allows you to focus deeply on your studies without the interruption of others, leading to a more in-depth understanding. Additionally, studying with a teacher can sometimes feel burdensome due to homework assignments. Nevertheless, I favor learning with a teacher over studying alone. \nFirstly, a key benefit of having a teacher is the ability to ask questions about study-related issues. In other words, when we face challenges in our studies that we cannot resolve ourselves, consulting a teacher is a beneficial way to address the issue promptly. Moreover, educators possess extensive experience and knowledge, and are adept at helping students grasp their subjects. They possess insights not found in standard resources like books and websites. Therefore, In class, I frequently discuss problems with my teacher to arrive at a shared solution, and my peers routinely engage with the teacher as well. \nSecondly, in my opinion, studying with a teacher is more productive than learning alone. We can complete our tasks more quickly with a teacher's guidance than on our own. Furthermore, teachers are crucial in steering us in the correct direction. In addition, This enables us to elevate our educational attainment to a remarkable level. knowledge can thus be enhanced and solidified.\nFinally, of course, learning without a teacher has its drawbacks. A significant drawback is that if someone encounters a particularly complex problem in their studies and their repeated attempts to resolve it fail, it could lead to frustration.

Although numerous medical breakthroughs, such as drugs for cancer and HIV, have been achieved through animal testing, many scientists argue that it is essential for enhancing human health. However, I contend that primates deserve equal rights to humans.\nThere are multiple arguments supporting the prohibition of animal testing. To begin with, the disadvantages surpass the advantages. Cosmetic companies, farms, and medical schools annually take the lives of millions of animals for product testing without yielding any positive outcomes. Animal testing is associated with significant financial expenses, because animals must be nourished, maintained, and subjected to drugs or experimental compounds.\nAdditionally, animals live in artificial environments. Recent research highlights that animals suffer neglect and poor treatment, which affects their reactions to medications. In March 2003, a laboratory technician captured footage within a lab, exposing primates confined in cages without pain relief, including a baboon with a metallic cylinder affixed to its head. As a result, I assert that the act of sacrificing animals is both costly and distressing.\nAnother point to consider is the violation of ethical and genetic standards during animal testing. A significant number of individuals concur that causing suffering to animals is not only brutal and heartless but also deceptive, given that the reactions of animals and humans to medication may differ.

Many individuals devote a significant amount of time to watching television, some even eat while watching it, and for others, it becomes a top priority.\nFirstly, a lot of individuals dedicate much of their time to television. Rather than spending time with their family and friends, they prefer to sit in front of the screen for hours. I know someone who, upon waking up in the morning, turns on the TV before even having breakfast, and records programs he misses during work hours. Sometimes, his wife wants to chat before heading to work, but he only lets her talk during commercial breaks. Consequently, She is so accustomed to his routine that she opts to email him instead. Family time is precious, and people need to recognize that and make an effort to engage in meaningful conversations.\nAnother way television disrupts communication is when individuals can't even sit down to have dinner with their families.

This trend persists in today's industrial society, where younger employees are often favored for hiring and promotion over those above 50. There are three reasons that explain their lack of responsiveness to the contemporary workplace.\nFirstly, older employees fall short compared to younger ones due to their outdated mindset. Having grown up in times of scarcity, possibly due to war, they tend to view the world negatively and with pessimism. Their minds are so steeped in hardship that they resist change, or more specifically, they deny the presence of modernity. For instance, Many prefer manually assembling machine parts rather than relying on robots, due to skepticism about the robots' efficiency and safety compared to human capabilities.\nSecondly, their lack of responsiveness is linked to their outlook on life. Simply put, They are conscious of their declining health and lack of zeal, preferring monotony and safe ideologies. This is decidedly overshadowed by the adventurous spirit and boldness of younger individuals. Clearly, the success of many companies is driven by young people, whose innovative ideas align with global trends and are seen as refreshing.\nLastly, education is a crucial factor that enables young workers to surpass older ones. Employers are more likely to choose between a senior with outdated education and a young person proficient in fundamental subjects, programming, and foreign languages.

{"id": "id_482", "input": "In the 19th century, television emerged as one of the most important inventions and has become an essential item in every household. Due to its easy accessibility and captivating programs, television captivates viewers of all ages and backgrounds. The issue of children becoming addicted to TV has sparked widespread debate about whether their screen time should be restricted. Personally, I believe that children should be prohibited from excessive television or movie watching.\nTo begin with, children generally possess weak self-discipline, making it easy for them to waste their time. Prolonged TV watching without completing homework is a major concern many parents face with their children. I was a typical example of this during my childhood. Whenever I returned home from school, my first action was to turn on the television and remain glued to it for hours. I could watch television for hours on end, but struggled to focus on my homework even for a few minutes. I could remember all the channels and programs, but couldn't recall any words from my textbooks. As a result, my academic performance suffered greatly due to a lack of study.\nFurthermore, Television programs often contain violence and sexual content, which can be detrimental to children. Children lack the maturity to discern what is beneficial or harmful, which is why they are prone to emulating behaviors seen on TV out of curiosity. Recently, there has been an increase in children smoking because they mimic the actions of characters in TV shows or movies. Even more concerning, Statistics indicate a rise in violent tendencies among children, with reports linking this to TV programs and movies. It is clear that numerous TV shows and movies are detrimental to children's mental and physical well-being. How can we expect children to excel in school if they exhibit such abnormal behaviors?\nWhile it's true that in terms of social interactions with peers, some might argue that children should be allowed to watch TV and movies for their diverse content, which can provide conversational topics. I partially agree with this perspective. Nevertheless, this doesn't imply that children should indulge excessively without supervision of their viewing choices. \nRegarding whether children's TV or movie viewing time should be limited, I firmly support this notion. Because children often struggle with time management and lack the maturity for sound judgment, hence they require careful monitoring while watching TV and movies.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay249", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 405, "to": 478}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 495, "to": 587}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 589, "to": 695}], "label": "Claim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 750, "to": 866}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 868, "to": 971}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 973, "to": 1068}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1070, "to": 1146}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1161, "to": 1260}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1262, "to": 1329}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1344, "to": 1409}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1411, "to": 1467}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1476, "to": 1534}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1558, "to": 1674}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1693, "to": 1782}], "label": "Claim", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1958, "to": 2074}], "label": "Claim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2131, "to": 2235}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2238, "to": 2339}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2349, "to": 2502}], "label": "Claim", "id": 17}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 13, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 13, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 13, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 13, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 15, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 2, 13, 14, 16, 17]}

From birth, parents guide us through basic skills like smiling and walking, as well as daily routines such as eating. Additionally, as we mature, they impart fairy tales and vital moral lessons that influence us throughout our lives.\nSecondly, while we learn extensive subjects like sciences and languages at school, our education continues with our parents at home.

I believe after leaving school, we might forget some lessons if we don't apply them in real life, yet I firmly maintain the teachings from our parents remain unforgettable because we incorporate their teachings into our daily lives. For instance, I am confident I will always remember my parents' lessons on appreciating those who assist me.\nThirdly, I am entirely convinced parents possess an unwavering love for their children. Consequently, even as we age, marry, and start our own families, parents continue to guide us in discerning right from wrong.

{"id": "id_484", "input": "The global crime rate is escalating at an alarming pace. Some people claim that this situation arises due to the frequent use of firearms by police officers to address criminal activities. Personally, I am inclined to disagree with this viewpoint, as I believe there are other factors contributing to the slight rise in violence levels.\nOn one hand, I acknowledge that police officers have the duty to manage violence in both urban and suburban areas, often employing firearms. A striking example of this occurred in the United States, where a man killed over ten people in a cinema using a firearm, and the police incapacitated him by shooting him in the leg. Clearly, law enforcement can compel criminals to give up, because officers are armed, which helps prevent dangerous criminals from escaping and threatening the public. Consequently, it is necessary to support police officers with certain military-grade weapons to safeguard the public and lower violence rates.\nConversely, there are several reasons contributing to the significant surge in violence within communities. To start, the unemployment rate has climbed to 15 percent in many countries, both globalized and non-globalized. Numerous highly qualified and educated individuals struggle to earn enough to live comfortably. Additionally, living costs in major cities are extremely high, compelling those living below the poverty line to resort to desperate measures to meet their basic needs. For example, many beggars have turned to pickpocketing on public transportation.\nIn conclusion, I am of the opinion that the firearms carried by police officers are not the cause of the increased violence levels.

Society indeed requires advertising, yet it is crucial for us to regulate the content and determine the types of products and services we wish to present to our audience.\nFirstly, I am in favor of the notion that advertising for alcohol, cigarettes, and adult-themed products and services should be forbidden because such advertisements can adversely influence our youth. Young people may feel compelled to purchase cigarettes or alcohol, potentially leading to habitual consumption. Luckily, some nations have taken significant steps to address this issue, prohibiting the advertisement of alcohol, cigarettes, and adult materials.\nConversely, advertising allows companies, enterprises, and individuals to showcase their products and services. Advertisements enable us to discover new offerings, compare them, and select what suits our needs best.\nNowadays, advertising is crucial not only for numerous companies but also for governments.

Some propose that reducing the need for people to venture onto the streets is the only way to tackle this seemingly insurmountable problem of traffic jams. Nonetheless, I strongly object to this notion, as there exist two other practical solutions aside from this approach.\nFirstly, public transportation plays a crucial role in reducing the number of cars on the roads. Buses and trains have been integrated into urban transport systems for quite some time and have proven themselves to be the most effective options among all. Clearly, a single bus can accommodate at least 30 passengers, while trains can hold nine to ten times that amount. Additionally, subway trains operate underground, leaving the streets above for buses and eco-friendly vehicles. Combined, these measures will help alleviate the congestion seen in many cities today.\nSecondly, we seldom recognize the beneficial presence of urban areas. It is suggested that relocating some of the massive shopping centers or universities to the outskirts could lead to less crowded and bustling city streets. Typically, equally distributing large attractions across a wider area fosters residential growth, easing the burden on public infrastructure.

Hence, this example distinctly shows that these high-profile celebrities adversely affect the behavior of young individuals.\nIn summary, it can be stated that when young people imitate celebrities, it negatively impacts both their health and behavior.

Therefore, the ability to manage stress, which involves mastering how to endure overwhelming pressure, is a crucial skill we all need. Let me outline my reasoning. \nStress, a natural reaction of our bodies to various demands, can stem from both positive and negative experiences. Stress can act as a positive catalyst, propelling us toward achievement. Nonetheless, many believe that stress strikes unexpectedly, hindering our objectives. Consequently, without effective stress management skills, we might encounter serious issues.\nIn today's hectic and rapidly changing environment, it is common for people of all ages, from youth to the elderly, to feel depressed due to stress from financial troubles, exam pressure, relationship strains, and excessive workload. Some view stress as a force that helps overcome barriers and inspires them to perform at their best; others struggle to manage their thoughts, emotions, and problem-solving approaches. Hence, stress management has recently gained prominence in our awareness.\nMoreover, stress adversely affects our health. It is understood that contemporary life is often laden with inconveniences, frustrations, and pressures. This is a contributing factor to why people feel overwhelmed by persistent stress. Thus, some individuals suffer from physical ailments like sleeplessness and headaches. Depression, the gravest issue, can even drive some individuals to take their own lives. In turn, it is essential to mitigate and manage our stress to achieve mental and physical balance. To steer clear of pessimism, we can attempt to overcome our distress by confiding in friends or family, engaging in regular physical activity, and adopting a new perspective on our challenges.\nFor these reasons, I contend that stress management is a vital skill for everyone to learn, enabling them to find personal solutions to their stress.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay179", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 141, "to": 263}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 295, "to": 408}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 410, "to": 481}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 496, "to": 567}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 583, "to": 660}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 662, "to": 894}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 896, "to": 995}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 997, "to": 1079}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1088, "to": 1153}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1165, "to": 1200}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1202, "to": 1305}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1307, "to": 1388}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1396, "to": 1475}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1477, "to": 1563}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1574, "to": 1662}], "label": "Claim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1891, "to": 2005}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 15}], "edges": [{"source": 4, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 4, 8, 14, 15]}

Some individuals believe that a strict and meticulous presentation of theories in the classroom is the most effective way to teach, while others contend that incorporating practical applications of those theories is more persuasive. Personally, I concur with the latter perspective that the most effective way for educators to engage students in a subject is by demonstrating its relevance and application to real-life situations beyond the classroom.\nTo begin with, demonstrating the subject's relevance to everyday life will leave a lasting impression on students, making them more enthusiastic and proactive about learning it. Take chemistry as an example; simply memorizing substance names and structural formulas can be tedious, whereas showing where and how chemical reactions occur nearby can spark students' curiosity and help them absorb classroom theories. During my senior high school years, my chemistry teacher once illustrated how detergent dissolves oil through an experiment, then guided us in explaining this process with formal structural formulas. Such a learning approach is more enjoyable and ultimately yields positive results. I associated the visual images from that experiment with the formula, and I rarely forget it, even though I'm no longer studying chemistry.\nAdditionally, linking theoretical knowledge to everyday events allows students to apply what they've learned to real life and enhances their problem-solving skills. This approach captures students' interest because as it involves assignments requiring real-world involvement. For instance, In law classes, students are made aware of their rights and responsibilities and taught how to apply legal principles to various situations they might encounter. When faced with any of these situations, they can independently assess and determine appropriate responses.\nIn summary, utilizing real-life experiences and examples to convey subject knowledge effectively captivates students and maintains their enthusiasm for learning, not only because it not only solidifies students' understanding of the material but also encourages them to apply what they've learned independently.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay253", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 334, "to": 497}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 514, "to": 675}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 677, "to": 912}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 914, "to": 1112}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1114, "to": 1195}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1197, "to": 1335}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1351, "to": 1500}], "label": "Claim", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1502, "to": 1543}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1552, "to": 1611}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1627, "to": 1787}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1789, "to": 1895}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1909, "to": 2057}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2076, "to": 2207}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 6, 11, 12]}

Some individuals opt to blend in and await opportunities, while others choose to stand out from the crowd. Which approach is more likely to lead to success? Personally, I hold that being distinct and unique is already a step toward success.\nFirstly, standing out positively often indicates that you've accomplished something greater than others. In a competitive world, life resembles a survival game. Only those equipped with the sharpest tools can endure. Failing to make yourself remarkable or failing to set yourself apart will lead to being easily replaced by someone more capable. For instance, during my college years, I was consistently picked to present group reports because I was the sole member in my team who could deliver the presentation comprehensively and smoothly.\nSecondly, uniqueness helps establish your own irreplaceable value. Simply put, being special and unique means actively shaping trends rather than waiting for others to notice and value you. Consider Apple, the most renowned and esteemed technology company. Its massive success stems from possessing exceptional qualities that competitors cannot match. Apple's operating systems operate more smoothly than others, and its design consistently captures consumer admiration.

My perspective is rooted in the idea that every difficult experience enhances our skills, sharpens our decision-making, and makes us more adaptable to life's demands.\nA prime illustration of this is how infants grasp fundamental survival skills during their early years. Each day presents new hurdles for them, such as learning to walk, eating, and more, yet the challenges faced in their early life instill crucial survival skills that are beneficial throughout their lives. For instance, in their attempts to walk, they often fall and injure themselves repeatedly. However, gradually, they refine their technique and master the art of walking.\nMany inventions and experiments result from numerous unfortunate observations. No scientist has achieved success on their first try. Scientists conduct multiple trials and tests on specimens before achieving their desired outcomes. It has been noted that Thomas Edison experimented with approximately 10,000 bulbs before successfully creating the light bulb. Thus, despite the initial difficulty and frustration, he explored more possibilities and discovered new insights with each attempt, ultimately achieving a breakthrough.\nOur challenging experiences unknowingly fortify and strengthen us. Although we may be enduring some of life's toughest moments, reflecting on them later instills confidence in our decisions and ourselves.

Firstly, we must acknowledge that expanding the use of these languages by the government can be quite costly as educational programs will be necessary to ensure young people continue to learn and use them. For instance, certain regions in Southern Vietnam have been assisting secondary school students of Khmer descent to speak their native language alongside Vietnamese, which means the local authorities have been facing challenges with the high expenses related to language teachers, facilities, and suitable materials. Moreover, it's evident that in areas such as communication, trade, cooperation, and transactions, it would be significantly easier for society to function using a single language.\nDespite these arguments, I firmly believe that the government ought to make efforts to preserve minority languages. This is due to the fact that language represents much more than just a means of communication. Additionally, the evolution of a language spans thousands of years, and hence, it warrants respect and preservation. Lastly, language is a key factor in shaping the world's diverse and unique cultures.

During these events, individuals from diverse nationalities, backgrounds, and religions coexist. It allows people to gain deeper insights into a country's culture, such interactions are beneficial in reducing inter-nation tensions. For instance, during the 2010 FIFA World Cup, the relationship between North Korea and South Korea was strained due to the sinking of a warship. The global community suspected North Korea of this hostile act. Nevertheless, as a result of the event, North Korea displayed friendship and enthusiasm. These are rare moments when people can learn about this nation.

While some argue that considerable time should be devoted to cooking, I firmly believe that people are inclined to allocate less time to cooking meals. There are several reasons underpinning this perspective, with two key ones standing out. \nThe foremost reason is that advancements in science and technology have led to the creation of sophisticated kitchen appliances, such as modern microwaves and advanced pressure cookers, enabling people to prepare and cook meals swiftly. Consequently, today, individuals typically spend just an hour preparing meals, unlike the two or three hours required a decade ago. Indeed, recent years have seen a notable rise in the number of individuals from diverse backgrounds recognizing the benefits these technologies offer in household chores. and this trend continues to grow alongside technological advancements. Therefore, it is foreseeable that devoting less time to cooking will become a predominant trend in the near future. \nAnother rationale is that a majority of young people opt for dining at restaurants because they wish to dedicate more time to their careers or studies to enhance their personal growth. A recent survey indicates that 89% of individuals now believe that, due to the competitive and pressure-filled environment they face, they must allocate substantial time to work, self-improvement, and skill acquisition. Hence, finding time for meal preparation and cooking proves challenging. even when they have some free time, they prefer socializing with friends to unwind and alleviate stress from work and study. \nWhile some may contend that investing ample time in cooking ensures nutritional value and quality for family meals, there's some truth to it. Nevertheless, in reality, employing technology or advanced equipment does not diminish the nutritional content and quality of food. moreover, ozone machines effectively eliminate bacteria, mold spores, and pesticides from vegetables, fruits, and other foods, thus ensuring the health and safety of those consuming the food. Moreover, alongside elevated living standards, product quality in most restaurants is now strictly monitored and regulated by relevant authorities. As a result, obtaining a nutritious meal with assured quality is simple, without requiring excessive time. \nIn conclusion, considering all these factors, it becomes evident that there are numerous compelling reasons to uphold my stance.

{"id": "id_503", "input": "Deciding on the most effective way to distribute the government's budget has been a popular subject of debate among the public. Recently, there has been an argument that the government should prioritize investment in healthcare and education over entertainment or sports amenities. From my perspective, this idea is advantageous for society.\nAddressing the needs of countless individuals affected by illness or lack of education is more pressing and practical than constructing theaters or sports venues. In reality, a person without education may hardly enjoy musicals, while someone suffering physically from inadequate medical care may be unable to engage in sports activities. Thus, it is more crucial for the government to focus on providing education and healthcare.\nFacilities for entertainment, like cinemas, theaters, and sports arenas, are primarily driven by profit. Their existence relies on marketing tactics, the state of the facilities, and audience numbers. The rivalry among these entertainment venues is a natural aspect of the free market and should remain uninfluenced by government. On the other hand, medical centers and educational institutions aim to enhance health and educational standards, not generate profit, which merits greater government funding.\nAdditionally, channeling taxpayer money into constructing theaters or sports venues is unjust to those who cannot utilize them.

Furthermore, acting in haste might also mean missing out on potential opportunities. Put another way, if the individual had paused to think through his decision, he might not have overlooked a job opening within the same company, albeit in a different role. Consequently, he could have avoided unemployment. Additionally, rash decisions not only become futile but can also impact a person's entire life. In simpler terms, once the individual has left his job and becomes jobless, he struggles to pay bills or purchase daily necessities, therefore, his life deteriorated significantly.

{"id": "id_506", "input": "Have you ever had the chance to see a bear or a monkey in person? If so, it was likely at a zoo. Zoos are expansive outdoor areas where various animal species are housed for public viewing, learning, and appreciation. Many people argue that zoos are pointless or serve no real function. I firmly oppose this notion because I am convinced that zoos offer opportunities for social engagement, educational experiences, and foster qualities like respect and understanding towards animals.\nPeople generally visit zoos with others, such as family groups or as part of school excursions. At the zoo, visitors can interact, unwind, observe animals, engage with some, discuss their traits and behaviors, and enjoy their amusing antics. Nowadays, families don't spend as much quality time together as they did a few decades back. Zoos provide a wonderful opportunity for family bonding, offering activities suitable for everyone, from young kids to grandparents. \nThe study of animals, their various species, habitats, and behaviors is an integral part of academic curricula. While books and lectures are informative, an even more effective learning method involves visual experiences and personal encounters. By visiting zoos, individuals can observe animals firsthand, learn about their habits, diets, and the traits unique to different species. Zoos allow people to see different variations within a species, such as males and females, or infants and adults. It provides a valuable chance to witness how animals react to various stimuli, including weather, species interaction, defense mechanisms, or caring for their young. Furthermore, it also aids in identifying which animals might pose a threat. A trip to the zoo can enhance students' comprehension of school teachings. \nIn conclusion, visiting a zoo can help cultivate a person's respect and admiration for animals. Appreciation becomes much easier after seeing and learning about something firsthand. This is particularly relevant for city dwellers, whose animal interactions are often limited to pets like cats and dogs. There is a noticeable decline in respect for animals in today's society. Being able to observe animals up close and gain knowledge about them can raise awareness about their significance and the respect they warrant.\nThe main reason why some people are against zoos is that some zoos do not provide adequate care for animals or maintain clean facilities. This criticism is largely valid, yet it doesn't address the fundamental purpose of zoos.

{"id": "id_507", "input": "While renewable energy sources are undeniably key components of both present and future energy strategies, in my opinion, these alternative energy sources cannot quickly replace fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas.\nTo begin with, renewable energy remains relatively costly due to technological constraints. The development of renewable energy technologies requires substantial financial investment, which many developing nations are unable to sustain. Conversely, fossil fuels are widely available and cost-effective in numerous regions. For instance, China is reported to have the world's largest coal reserves, and its government prefers not to allocate excessive funds toward costly renewable energy options like solar panels and wind turbines. As a result, the transition to renewable energy resources might encounter obstacles, as not all nations are financially equipped to undertake such reforms.\nFurthermore, although energy companies assert that renewable energy is environmentally beneficial, these energy sources may not be as eco-friendly or sustainable as commonly believed. Recent research indicates that renewable energy sources have their own challenges and could potentially pose long-term environmental risks. For example, hydroelectric dams disrupt river water flow, occasionally leading to droughts in upstream areas. This disruption harms ecosystems, affecting habitats of valuable fish species and wading birds. Beyond that, the buildup of heavy metals in riverbed sediment behind dams is both difficult and costly to remove, creating problems for future generations. Therefore, renewable energy sources are not as dependable as they are often perceived to be.\nCertainly, currently, fossil fuels contribute to significant environmental issues like acid rain, the depletion of the ozone layer, and global warming, but these issues can be mitigated by enhancing efficiency and curbing emissions. For instance, chemical treatments can be employed to remove sulfur from emissions produced by industrial plants and vehicles, thereby preventing acid rain. Such measures are often simpler and less costly when compared to the advanced technologies required for renewable energy. These approaches make fossil fuels appear more viable in the long term.\nIn summary, despite the appealing promise of renewable energy sources, it is unlikely that new energy sources will replace fossil fuels in the near future.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay185", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 128, "to": 225}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 242, "to": 317}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 319, "to": 462}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 476, "to": 548}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 564, "to": 758}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 773, "to": 914}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 938, "to": 1013}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1015, "to": 1098}], "label": "Claim", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1100, "to": 1238}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1253, "to": 1348}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1350, "to": 1444}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1459, "to": 1600}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1613, "to": 1693}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1706, "to": 1845}], "label": "Claim", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1851, "to": 1926}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1942, "to": 2082}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2084, "to": 2204}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2206, "to": 2276}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2349, "to": 2432}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 18}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 6, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 13, "target": 14, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 13, "target": 15, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 13, "target": 16, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 13, "target": 17, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 1, 7, 13, 18]}

Those who thrive are the ones who swiftly adapt to this rapidly evolving world. Previously, mastering a single skill sufficed to tackle issues, as industries were relatively small and straightforward to manage. Yet, as industries grow and globalize, individuals must develop a range of skills to meet these challenges. For instance, there are now greater opportunities to engage in business with international partners, making language proficiency becomes crucial alongside one's professional expertise. As a further example, financial crimes have become prevalent in the 21st century, resulting in increasing the demand for professionals skilled in both legal and financial realms. \nMoreover, this generation faces the issue of self-discovery, which was not encountered by previous generations. Earlier generations had less autonomy and were often expected to follow paths laid out by their parents. Conversely, today's youth are exposed to more innovative ideas and tend to think independently. They have a strong desire to understand their own identities and true aspirations. It is fortunate that they can grapple with these appealing dilemmas, which are indeed challenging.

Hence, acquiring knowledge about life, which helps foresee problems and be assertive enough to tackle them, is essential. Two primary methods of learning about life are listening to the advice of family and friends and gaining insights through personal experience. Both approaches are valuable as they offer unique advantages.\nOn one hand, learning about life by listening to the advice of family and friends is more practical than through personal experience. Family members, like your parents, possess life experiences that allow them to offer sincere and appropriate guidance on various life matters. And friends, who belong to the same generation as you, understand your preferences and abilities well enough to guide you on what suits you and what doesn\u2019t. By heeding the advice of your family and friends, you can definitely steer clear of many unforeseen challenges.\nOn the other hand, discovering life through personal experiences fosters greater independence and maturity. For one thing, there are numerous remarkable experiences you might miss if you don't explore them firsthand. For example, a friend advised against trying skydiving due to its dangers. If you followed their advice, you might miss out on the exhilarating experience of freefalling. In addition, family and friends might inadvertently hinder you by constantly offering advice. This could lead to becoming dependent and reliant. In contrast, pursuing your desires without worrying about the consequences is a path chosen by many successful individuals.\nFrom my perspective, both approaches are beneficial, but I lean towards the latter. This is because personal growth is a lengthy journey where experience is irreplaceable. I am convinced that by experiencing real life on my own, I can learn more than by merely following advice.

However, the question of the appropriate age for them to leave their parental home and start living alone is quite debatable. In my view, I assert that young adults should remain with their parents for an extended period.\nLiving independently comes with significant financial responsibilities. At a younger age, individuals are less likely to secure well-paying jobs, hence Managing expenses like rent, food, utilities, and other necessities can be challenging. Consequently, I hold the opinion that staying with parents is a prudent decision for young adults until they establish their careers with stable earnings.\nAdditionally, residing with parents longer fosters stronger emotional bonds with them. Parents offer invaluable guidance to their children as they navigate adult life changes. Living together creates a setting where discussions about adults' physical and mental changes can happen openly with parents. Young adults may hesitate to discuss such issues if they live alone, missing out on their parents' crucial input.\nWhile some opponents might suggest that, young adults living with parents might feel restricted in their personal freedom. Nonetheless, I argue that many young adults tend to exploit the newfound freedom excessively. It's beneficial if living with parents limits young people's opportunities to engage in late-night partying, smoking, or drug use.\nUltimately, I maintain that young adults should only opt for independent living after ensuring they can support themselves financially. It is unwise to forgo the advantage of extended parental cohabitation for the sake of late-night socializing or substance use. Therefore, to navigate the physical and mental transitions of adulthood, ease financial burdens, and stay on their intended path, it's crucial for young adults to live with their parents longer.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay332", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 252, "to": 320}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 322, "to": 392}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 394, "to": 466}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 474, "to": 560}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 600, "to": 715}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 717, "to": 802}], "label": "Claim", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 804, "to": 891}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 893, "to": 1017}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1019, "to": 1131}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1174, "to": 1254}], "label": "Claim", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1282, "to": 1348}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1350, "to": 1479}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1509, "to": 1615}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1617, "to": 1742}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1755, "to": 1937}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 14}], "edges": [{"source": 3, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 10, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 9, "target": 11, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 4, 5, 9, 12, 14]}

Children are significantly influenced by two key figures: their parents and their teachers, both playing vital roles in their development. From my perspective, I support the notion that in certain aspects, teachers are the superior choice for educating children. \nFirstly, teachers at schools possess more expertise in education than parents. For example, to earn teaching credentials, individuals must undergo years of training at educational institutions to acquire theoretical knowledge. On the other hand, parents generally have less expertise in teaching subjects like mathematics and physics compared to teachers.\nMoreover, educators are skilled and seasoned in nurturing children's communication abilities. For instance, with extensive teaching experience, teachers understand how to assist children in developing crucial life skills, such as setting personal boundaries, tackling future challenges, and learning effective conflict resolution. Conversely, parents often struggle with a generation gap, making them less adept at managing family disputes efficiently. \nAdditionally, unlike teachers, parents lack sufficient time to dedicate to their children. In today's global economic downturn, it is essential for both parents to be employed, resulting in leaving them with only a limited amount of time to educate their children. Therefore, it becomes impractical for them to excel as educators.\nTo sum up, teachers are the most effective for children's learning.

Indeed, mobile phones are extensively utilized by individuals across all age groups. However, I am convinced that this remarkable 21st-century invention brings numerous challenges to our society.\nFirstly, excessive time spent on mobile phones can negatively influence our social abilities. For instance, as people, particularly teenagers, become increasingly absorbed in their phones, they may lose interest in everyday activities like socializing with friends, which can hinder their future negotiation and interpersonal abilities. Additionally, constant use of mobile phones can also harm children's vision and physical posture. Consequently, frequent mobile phone usage is detrimental to us.\nMoreover, the surge in mobile games will affect their cognitive growth. For example, there are numerous game apps available online, many of which are quite violent. In these games, children earn rewards by helping their characters defeat or shoot rivals or characters controlled by other players, potentially fostering aggressive emotions, ideas, and actions. As a result, frequent conflicts may arise during interactions.\nNonetheless, this issue can be seen from various perspectives. Mobile phones, particularly smartphones, have simplified and streamlined our communication. This is because because most telecommunications providers offer internet access via our phones, individuals can enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls without cost. Therefore, mobile phones have bridged the gap in communication.\nIn conclusion, although mobile phones accelerate our communication, they also contribute to various social issues, including the impact on children's social skills and mental health.

Nonetheless, gun control varies, with some countries exhibiting more lenient regulations than others, making this a divisive global issue.

Accidents are inevitable, even when gun ownership is restricted to licensed individuals. For instance, there are occasional reports of accidental injuries occurring during hunting activities. Consequently, a reduction in gun ownership correlates with fewer accidents, thereby enhancing the safety and lowering accident rates in our environment.\nAdditionally, the misuse of firearms is a common factor in the majority of violent offenses, particularly in nations where guns are readily accessible to the public. Ultimately, if this trend persists, guns will contribute to a more violent society. For example, in the United States, both young adults and minors can obtain firearms, resulting in tragic school shootings. Even more concerning, certain terrorists can acquire more sophisticated weaponry than law enforcement, perpetually endangering citizens.\nFurthermore, gun ownership can also lead to increased suicide rates. In the United States, firearms are the predominant method of suicide, accounting for approximately half of all cases. Regrettably, there is a rising trend of suicides among teenagers and individuals aged 75 and older.\nTo sum up, in light of the escalating rates of accidents, violent crimes, and suicides, I am in favor of guns should be rigorously controlled, and the government must implement comprehensive legislation to safeguard society from violence.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay036", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 288, "to": 348}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 419, "to": 506}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 522, "to": 609}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 625, "to": 762}], "label": "Claim", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 778, "to": 928}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 942, "to": 1012}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1027, "to": 1135}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1159, "to": 1272}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1287, "to": 1341}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1343, "to": 1459}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1474, "to": 1559}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1572, "to": 1647}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1666, "to": 1798}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 12}], "edges": [{"source": 3, "target": 1, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 3, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 3, 4, 8, 11, 12]}

{"id": "id_528", "input": "From ancient times, humans have regarded meat as an essential source of protein. It has traditionally been the centerpiece of meals in households worldwide. In recent years, however, there has been a significant surge in the number of people adopting vegetarian diets. Some attribute this trend to concerns over animal rights, while others believe there are additional reasons. To me, it's apparent that individuals abstain from meat primarily due to health and religious reasons.\nFirstly, the primary factor driving the popularity of vegetarianism is its health benefits. Numerous studies have indicated that various vegetables are rich in antioxidants, which can help in cancer prevention. This reinforces the notion that a plant-based diet is beneficial for our health. Although there are arguments suggesting that a diet lacking meat might result in insufficient protein, it is demonstrated that legumes like soybeans and peas are also excellent sources of protein.\nSecondly, religious beliefs also play a role in promoting a vegetarian lifestyle. Certain religions, like Buddhism, hold the belief that animals could be reincarnated humans, so consuming their meat is akin to eating the flesh of one's ancestral beings. While some argue that this perspective lacks scientific basis, I firmly believe that adhering to one's religious beliefs is crucial as it can lead to spiritual enlightenment.\nIn conclusion, it is clear to me that individuals opt for vegetarianism due to health and spiritual motivations rather than animal welfare.

Though many smokers argue that smoking helps them work more efficiently or sparks creativity, these arguments fail to demonstrate any health benefits of smoking. In my view, smoking should be prohibited, particularly in public venues like restaurants since it will cause discomfort for non-smokers by affecting their breathing.\nFirstly, restaurants are establishments where people pay to relax and savor their food. Smoking in eateries can significantly interfere with others' enjoyment of their meals. They won't be able to fully appreciate their meals while surrounded by smoke. \nSecondly, restaurants are often visited by families.

Pregnant women are the most vulnerable to the dangers of secondhand smoke as they inhale polluted air, which can hinder the baby's development.\nMoreover, passive smokers face numerous health hazards. Being near active smokers exposes them to harmful smoke. Diseases such as stroke, heart conditions, hearing impairment, and various cancers can affect passive smokers. From my perspective, it is unjust towards passive smokers because they do not smoke, yet they face the same health threats as active smokers.\nIn summary, smoking should be banned in restaurants as many individuals would be adversely affected.

Serious films are often crafted to convey reflections on themes such as love and humanity; furthermore, they might also highlight societal issues.\nSecondly, not every serious movie is dull. \"Click\" is an entertaining comedy that seriously addresses the importance of maintaining a balance between family life and work. The film is both humorous and satirical, prompting us to consider what truly matters in life and reminding us of our family's significance. Consequently, serious films often contain deeper meanings that transcend mere visuals and dialogue, encouraging introspection.\nAdditionally, certain serious films challenge viewers to contemplate the grim aspects of the world. \"Blood Diamond,\" based on a true story from South Africa, examines the connection between diamonds and warfare. Watching the film might impart a lesson about the relationship between gemstones and mortality. Diamonds are neither rare nor symbols of genuine love; in fact, their deeper meaning is a harsh reality.

{"id": "id_532", "input": "Numerous business owners speculate that offering lifetime employment to workers is a safer strategy to maintain productivity and efficiency. In my view, these beliefs are not only conservative but also outdated. I lean towards the opposite stance that businesses should avoid employing workers for their entire lives due to three key reasons. \nTo begin with, the influx of diverse ideas and creativity from various individuals is essential for a company's growth. While senior employees can impart their invaluable experience to young apprentices who are familiar with new roles, these apprentices frequently contribute fresh and innovative ideas. Additionally, today's fast-paced advancements across all sectors demand precise updates and access to new knowledge. Consequently, young individuals are well-equipped to meet these expectations. Of greater importance, they possess energy, creativity, and initiative, enabling them to excel in their roles. These crucial elements can determine whether a company succeeds or fails.\nSecondly, employees can quickly become bored with a long-term stable job. At certain points, they might consider job security as the most vital necessity because they need to earn an income to sustain their lives. Following this, many of them realize that promotions and competition can help them enhance their skills and expand their knowledge as well. Numerous individuals enjoy challenging themselves since they do not wish to become stagnant and inactive. A monotonous environment soon leads to their discontent, which means this scenario will negatively affect the company. \nLastly, the economic downturn and financial recession have caused a significant spike in unemployment. From my perspective, businesses should hire a wide range of workers to address this pressing issue. It allows the unemployed to improve their living conditions and earn a livelihood. Moreover, factories and companies will have a plentiful workforce to maintain production levels and generate numerous innovative ideas. \nIn summary, the diverse traits of different individuals, the fatigue of sticking to one job, and addressing unemployment lead me to support the idea that employers should refrain from hiring staff for their entire lifetime.

{"id": "id_534", "input": "Technology propels the pace of human evolution forward. Thanks to cutting-edge advancements, many feats once thought unattainable are now within our grasp. For instance, in the past, the idea of communicating with anyone at any moment or seeing someone across the globe on a computer screen was unimaginable, yet today, cellphones and the internet make these possible. Still, some argue that technology stifles children's creativity. I acknowledge that technology might have adverse effects on young minds, but I contend that technology enhances children's creativity.\nFirstly, technology ignites children's imagination to innovate. Children have a natural curiosity about their surroundings, therefore when they encounter a high-tech device like a smartphone, they become fascinated by its enigmatic features and eager to understand its workings. To illustrate, Bill Gates was captivated by the early large computers and pursued every opportunity to comprehend their mechanisms. After mastering the technology, he went on to advocate for computers. Ultimately, he invented a user-friendly and compact computer. Consequently, rather than hindering creativity, technology motivates children to learn and innovate.\nSecondly, technology expands children's horizons. In the past, children viewed the world from a singular viewpoint. However, with sophisticated technology, children can access information from abroad and even interact with international peers. As a result, they can discover various cultures and diverse thinking methods. A solid foundation of knowledge fuels creativity. The extensive knowledge children acquire from around the globe stimulates and inspires them to invent.\nCertainly, technology can have drawbacks for children.

This harmful habit also poses health risks to those exposed to secondhand smoke: individuals who are present where smoking occurs. Consequently, it is proposed that smoking should be outlawed in public venues such as bus and train stations. This stance will be demonstrated by examining the advantages it offers to both the general populace and smokers themselves.\nTo begin with, the non-smoking community would undoubtedly benefit from enforcing such restrictions. Before the 1980s, public areas in Sri Lanka depicted a distressing scenario where individuals smoked without restraint. Even on public transport, individuals indulged in this intolerable vice, occasionally resulting in aggressive incidents. Once restrictions were implemented, the situation was brought under control, thereby benefiting the public.\nMoreover, introducing a smoking ban in public areas would significantly deter individuals from tobacco use. For example, additional enforcement that banned smoking in the capital of Sri Lanka has decreased diseases and deaths linked to tobacco consumption, according to the Ministry of Health. As demonstrated, smoking restrictions have effectively dissuaded the public from this harmful habit, reducing the burden on the country's healthcare system.\nUpon reviewing the prohibition of smoking in public areas in Sri Lanka, the advantages of this policy are evident in the benefits enjoyed by people.

Personally, such a plan ought to be executed for the two reasons outlined below.\nIntegrating health education into school curriculums, especially at the primary level, is undeniably crucial to heighten public awareness. Educating children about balanced nutrition, wholesome foods, and the dangers of harmful ones is essential, which ensures they will develop a solid understanding of how to live a healthy life. Furthermore, it is significantly easier for young individuals to cultivate habits such as limiting fast food, avoiding overly fried items, or steering clear of intoxicants.\nAdditionally, prioritizing prevention can offer substantial economic advantages by reducing the prevalence of certain diseases. It goes without saying that incurable illnesses like cancer or HIV demand exorbitant expenses, not for a cure, but merely to extend life by a few years. In the same vein, maintaining regular fitness routines through outdoor activities or using health-care products can effectively prevent issues such as obesity, myopia, and other costly health conditions.\nIn conclusion, I must acknowledge the practicality of shifting resources from treatment-focused approaches to investments in health education and preventative initiatives.

{"id": "id_540", "input": "The debate over whether successful individuals typically embrace risk or stick to familiar paths is quite heated, and the complexity of the topic allows for various perspectives. Some argue that venturing into the unknown is key to success, while others hold an opposing view. After contemplating this issue thoroughly, I've arrived at my own stance. I support the latter; that is, successful people continue to engage in activities they are familiar with.\nThe primary reason is rooted in the undeniable truth that to achieve success, we strive to minimize the risks we might face. The fewer the failure-inducing factors we have, the greater our chances of success. Consider a scenario where an individual becomes wealthy due to extensive investment knowledge. He can concentrate on specific companies he believes are worthy of investment and then simply wait for consistent, albeit moderate, returns. He doesn't need to invest in high-risk companies for greater profit, which could lead to quick bankruptcy. Consequently, we can begin to concur that successful people do not need to experiment with new things or take risks.\nAdditionally, another equally significant factor is that one's ability determines whether they can achieve success or not. At the very least, a successful individual should be able to overcome the obstacles hindering their success. For example, sports stars do not need to use performance-enhancing drugs to win or display their exceptional skills. The reason for their success lies in their superior abilities in the sports domain. Conversely, those athletes who seek to stand out by taking risks with drugs fail to succeed. Thus, from this example, we can assert that it is unnecessary for successful individuals to take risks.\nAdmittedly, there are those who assert that trying something new is essential for achieving success because they can distinguish themselves from others, a commonly accepted notion for success. However, from my perspective, I question the validity of this claim due to its rashness. Experimenting with new things can indeed make people stand out, but it doesn't guarantee success. \nConsidering the arguments presented above, I maintain that continuing with familiar activities can still lead to success because the benefits of this approach outweigh those of the alternative. Simply put, minimizing risks and honing personal skills is the most critical route to success. This is not to say, of course, that other perspectives lack merit entirely.

{"id": "id_541", "input": "Distance learning offers numerous benefits, yet it should not serve as a substitute for traditional classroom learning. Classroom learning can offer more extensive information for study. Additionally, Classroom education involves not only academic learning but also the acquisition of social skills and problem-solving in real-life situations. As a result, I strongly oppose the idea that conventional courses should be replaced by online courses. Here are the reasons backing my viewpoint.\nFirst and foremost, Classroom learning can provide additional information and enhance students' comprehension of the subjects they study. This is because Classrooms are equipped with various tools to demonstrate real-life examples. For instance, In biology classes, learning anatomy through frog dissection offers multiple advantages. Students can learn how to use the instruments and observe the actual organs of a frog. In contrast to physical classrooms, Online courses mainly involve textbook study without exposure to real-world situations.\nFurthermore, Online classes fail to impart knowledge about social skills. For example, In a classroom setting, teachers can assign group projects to students. This approach helps students learn interpersonal skills and collaboration within their groups. This crucial ability cannot be acquired through online learning.\nFinally, Classroom learning promotes a healthier lifestyle for students because Schools offer physical education classes that encourage students to stay active. Classrooms have professional trainers to instruct students correctly. Students may risk injury if they attempt exercises on their own. This contributes to a healthier lifestyle, which online classes cannot guarantee. \nIn summary, I am personally against the idea of replacing traditional classrooms with online classes.

The subject of teaching financial management to young students is consistently debated. Some argue that imparting money management skills to teenagers will instill in them the value of money, while others believe that introducing children to financial concepts at this age might have adverse effects. Personally, I concur with the notion that it is beneficial for high school students to be educated about money management.\nThe reason behind my belief that adolescents should grasp the basics of managing finances is primarily due to as high school students reach the age for college, they often live in dorms or with peers, away from family; learning financial management early on grants them a heightened sense of responsibility and self-assurance. For instance, when I was young, my father kept a monthly expense log and encouraged me to do the same with my pocket money; this practice in later life helped me effectively plan my expenditures.\nMoreover, early financial education equips students with a better understanding of their family's financial situation, reducing unrealistic expectations. For example, purchasing a gaming console might be trivial for a student from a wealthy background. Nonetheless, for a student from a middle-class family, a gaming console may not be a priority. Consequently, being introduced to financial management in high school enables students to prioritize financial obligations effectively.\nUltimately, I am of the opinion that students who comprehend financial management techniques experience more positive outcomes than negative effects.

Consequently, some businesses have banned smoking on their premises, and certain governments have imposed restrictions on smoking in public areas.

Recent mortality statistics from the Malaysian Ministry of Health indicate that lung-related illnesses caused by smoking are the leading cause of death. A significant number of these deaths involve secondhand smokers, notably young children and pregnant women who are particularly susceptible to these deadly diseases. Therefore, a comprehensive ban on smoking in public places could greatly decrease the number of fatalities.\nSecondly, by enforcing strict penalties on public smoking, governments can enhance the image of a healthy nation. For example, the government of Brunei recently implemented a ban on smoking in public spaces like caf\u00e9s, hospitals, and shopping streets. This action has resulted in a decrease in the smoking population, helping Brunei maintain its reputation for peace and cleanliness. This case exemplifies the advantages of limiting public smoking for the country as a whole.\nIn conclusion, efforts to restrict smoking in public spaces are indeed aiding in reducing health risks and fostering a healthier nation.

While some contend that the integration of cutting-edge plant foods with modern agricultural machinery dramatically lowers the cost of farming, others maintain that this combination leads to adverse effects on human health and societal well-being.\nAdmittedly, utilizing advanced fertilizers alongside automated harvesting technologies boosts farmers' economic gains. This is because synthetic fertilizers enhance the productivity of each unit of farmland, while automated machinery significantly improves harvesting efficiency. As a result, the costs associated with production and labor per kilogram of agricultural goods have substantially reduced.\nOn the other hand, modern fertilizers may pose serious risks to individual health. Unlike organic fertilizers, industrial ones are composed of synthetic chemicals that not only alter crop genetics unpredictably but also leave residues within the plants indefinitely. Therefore, individuals consuming these chemically-treated products regularly are prone to developing health issues over time.\nFurthermore, over-reliance on automated harvesting equipment has significant societal repercussions. One consequence is the exacerbation of air pollution due to the excessive release of emissions. Conversely, manual harvesting methods help mitigate severe environmental harm. Additionally, mechanized harvesting contributes to higher unemployment rates within the farming sector, likely due to state-of-the-art harvesting machinery takes over jobs traditionally performed by field workers.\nTo conclude, although advanced plant foods and agricultural machinery have brought notable financial benefits to farmers, it is evident that the drawbacks of adopting these innovations in agriculture cannot be ignored.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay115", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 362, "to": 467}], "label": "Premise", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 485, "to": 628}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 643, "to": 751}], "label": "Claim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 772, "to": 834}], "label": "Claim", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 836, "to": 1018}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1031, "to": 1144}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1159, "to": 1245}], "label": "Claim", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1247, "to": 1341}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1355, "to": 1420}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1436, "to": 1524}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1540, "to": 1634}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1658, "to": 1756}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1777, "to": 1853}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 12}], "edges": [{"source": 0, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 0, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [2, 3, 6, 11, 12]}

Typically, members of the latter group find it challenging to allocate time for exercise. We all recognize that engaging in physical activity for at least 30 minutes a day is fundamental to a healthy and fulfilling life. However, I don't believe that an equal amount of funding should be allocated to academic resources like libraries and labs as well as physical or social activities.\nFirstly, in my opinion, allocating excessive funds for gym equipment or building sports courts like those for football or basketball isn't essential to motivate students to participate in sports. For instance, my roommate, Mary, consistently wakes up at 6 AM and dedicates an hour to exercising in the nearby park. Upon returning to the dorm, she is brimming with energy and, after showering, she is prepared for a productive day. Clearly, she manages to work out without spending any money. The university should focus on educating students about the advantages of physical activity by putting up posters around campus, inviting athletes to speak, and encouraging students to dedicate time to their physical well-being.\nMoreover, students select their courses based on personal interests. The university ought to equip physical education students with the finest resources. This is because their field of study is entirely centered around physical activities. Conversely, for students pursuing engineering or medicine, it seems unfair to prioritize gym facilities over lab resources, since it truly inspires students to engage with innovative technology to learn and potentially make new discoveries in their area of study.\nLastly, investing in social activities appears to be a waste of funds.

For example, when my friends and I wish to hang out, we opt to visit places outside the university to avoid running into familiar faces.\nIn summary, I acknowledge the role of sports in contributing to the success of university students, yet I believe sports and social activities should not be funded equally with academic facilities like libraries and labs.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay268", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 384, "to": 538}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 564, "to": 734}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 750, "to": 853}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 855, "to": 969}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 980, "to": 1030}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1032, "to": 1259}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1271, "to": 1328}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1330, "to": 1413}], "label": "Claim", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1431, "to": 1499}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1513, "to": 1623}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1631, "to": 1763}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1773, "to": 1834}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1836, "to": 1927}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1942, "to": 2064}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2078, "to": 2164}], "label": "Claim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2180, "to": 2286}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 15}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 7, 11, 14, 15]}
{"id": "id_550", "input": "Libraries and sports activities are crucial elements in the success of universities. Most university rankings consider the quality of these two activities. From my perspective, universities should prioritize investment in libraries above other areas.\nTo begin with, I believe a library is an essential and strategic component of a university. All professors and students require access to a modern and well-equipped library because, in the era of the internet, the library holds a significant role in research. Even though sports are important, they do not hold the same level of priority as libraries do. Moreover, only a small fraction of students participate in sports activities. For instance, at my university, the number of students who use the library greatly exceeds those involved in sports activities.\nSecondly, libraries typically do not generate income. Most libraries offer free access not only to students but also to the public. Therefore, support from universities is crucial for the sustainability of libraries. However, sports activities can generate significant revenue because each sport hosts various matches, attracting numerous sponsors. Additionally, they have the opportunity to sell tickets for their major matches. In summary, there are effective ways for sports activities to cover their costs, but it is challenging for libraries to find viable income sources.\nLast but not least, investing in libraries yields long-term benefits. For example, a library can acquire many new books or invest in additional computers. Most library resources are durable and can be utilized over an extended period. Furthermore, in the distant future, they become more valuable. Conversely, most sports facilities, aside from buildings, are often short-lived and lack long-term durability.\nDespite the significance of sports activities, libraries hold greater importance.

{"id": "id_552", "input": "When faced with the decision of where to live after completing high school, most students often find themselves torn between two main options: residing in an apartment or staying in university dormitories. In my view, each option presents unique pros and cons. \nOn one hand, staying in a dormitory allows students to immerse themselves in the university's academic atmosphere. For example, students have opportunities to engage in various extracurricular activities on campus, such as joining a conversation club or participating in sports. students also have increased opportunities to interact with their teachers and peers. Moreover, seeking assistance is easier for students when they encounter issues, like asking roommates, classmates, or teachers for help with math problems. I believe that living in a dormitory consistently benefits students. \nConversely, residing off-campus equips students for real-world experiences. For instance, students acquire numerous skills, such as responsibility, independence, punctuality, and cooperation, more so than in university dorms. they must manage everything, including timely rent payments and handling utility bills. Additionally, students must also concentrate on their studies and strive to maintain high grades. Furthermore, students have the opportunity to learn about the surrounding community. engaging with people and building social networks prepares students for life post-graduation. \nBased on the available evidence, it appears challenging for students to decide between these living arrangements since both living options offer distinct advantages.

{"id": "id_554", "input": "Emerging in the late 1700s, industrialization and urbanization sparked a surge in the number of automobiles. The fuel they depend on, oil, has now become a major pollutant affecting urban environments. Critics decry the excessive oil consumption, and some propose imposing extra charges on drivers during peak hours due to their self-centered behavior. My stance is that drivers should not be subjected to additional charges. Here are the reasons. \nCapitalism has granted individuals the right to own property, which includes the freedom to utilize these assets. While driving during peak hours can lead to environmental pollution in cities, drivers are legally permitted to do so, and thus, imposing extra fees on drivers might exceed legal boundaries. From another perspective, traffic congestion is an inevitable occurrence that cannot be entirely avoided or prohibited; therefore it is beyond the control of individual drivers. Why should drivers be penalized just for using their cars at certain times? Wars are infamous, yet it's unjust to blame soldiers who are simply defending their nations.\nPurchasing a vehicle costs a substantial amount; covering various fees adds more financial strain, which is already overwhelming for many families. Adding another fee for drivers is illogical and absurd. Most families invest in cars for safer and more convenient transportation, and overburdening them with excessive fees undermines their rights and places undue stress on them.\nInstead of passively demanding extra payments from drivers, the government should actively promote the use of efficient, eco-friendly energy and develop better urban designs that facilitate oil-free commuting. Traffic congestion sometimes arises from a faulty traffic signal or poorly planned road systems. In such scenarios, the one deserving a penalty is the city planner, not the drivers. To put it simply, imposing fees on drivers regardless of the underlying issues can be nonsensical and potentially unlawful. \nIn summary, \"rush hours\" are often not directly attributable to the actions of drivers. Instead, the primary causes of traffic congestion could stem from various factors, and as a result, charging drivers an additional fee for this scenario may be unjustified and irrational.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay318", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 371, "to": 424}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 449, "to": 561}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 563, "to": 680}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 692, "to": 752}], "label": "Claim", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 780, "to": 872}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 884, "to": 930}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1008, "to": 1099}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1101, "to": 1247}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1249, "to": 1303}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1305, "to": 1378}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1384, "to": 1478}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1480, "to": 1688}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1690, "to": 1785}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1806, "to": 1870}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1890, "to": 1994}], "label": "Claim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2009, "to": 2083}], "label": "Claim", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2185, "to": 2271}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 16}], "edges": [{"source": 3, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 3, 8, 11, 14, 15, 16]}

{"id": "id_556", "input": "In the whirlwind of today's fast-paced society, life is becoming increasingly complicated and challenging compared to the past. Consequently, it's crucial for individuals, particularly the youth, to develop skills in planning and organization because it enhances efficiency and minimizes the risk of crises in our actions. At the same time, this helps in discarding futile activities.\nFirstly, strong planning and organizing skills can make our actions more effective and fruitful. For instance, I used to feel overwhelmed with preparing for finals, submitting papers, and completing internship tasks at the end of each term. However, this year, following my roommate John's advice, I created a detailed to-do list to plan and organize everything perfectly for finals, allowing me to manage all tasks and minor details effectively. This ability to plan has greatly benefited me, enabling me to achieve top ranks in my class while completing other responsibilities.\nEqually significant, the skill to plan and organize also assists young people in avoiding crises in their actions, which could undermine long-term efforts. It's widely acknowledged that employees in every company are required to generate as much profit as possible for their supervisors and flawlessly complete their tasks. Employees lacking the foresight to plan and organize may procrastinate, only acting when deadlines loom close. Yet, circumstances are always evolving. For example, a task deadline is moved up due to changes in the company's schedule. In such situations, employees who failed to plan and complete their tasks ahead of time may find themselves unable to meet these new deadlines and face penalties or termination. No employee can afford such a setback.\nFinally, some argue that the skill to plan and organize can be acquired once one secures a job. Therefore, it's not necessary for young people to develop this skill beforehand. However, this skill is also vital for young people as young individuals can overcome bad habits and achieve their goals more swiftly with this ability. While searching for information online, young people can easily be sidetracked by distractions like online games or social media. In these scenarios, they may spend hours aimlessly browsing the internet. This is clearly a significant waste of time. But if they establish a plan initially and adhere to it, they could accomplish their tasks far quicker than they imagined.\nIn this intricate society, young individuals are surrounded by numerous responsibilities, hence the skill of planning and organizing is undeniably a powerful and essential tool we must possess.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay270", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 142, "to": 242}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 251, "to": 321}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 394, "to": 480}], "label": "Claim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 482, "to": 624}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 626, "to": 830}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 832, "to": 963}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 986, "to": 1119}], "label": "Claim", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1151, "to": 1287}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1289, "to": 1398}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1453, "to": 1521}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1543, "to": 1699}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1701, "to": 1738}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1765, "to": 1834}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1847, "to": 1915}], "label": "Claim", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1926, "to": 1967}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1971, "to": 2067}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2069, "to": 2197}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2219, "to": 2271}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2273, "to": 2316}], "label": "Premise", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2322, "to": 2439}], "label": "Premise", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2441, "to": 2529}], "label": "Claim", "id": 20}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2537, "to": 2633}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 21}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 13, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 13, "target": 14, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 13, "target": 19, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 14, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 19, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 19, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 19, "target": 18, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 6, 13, 20, 21]}

Let's explore both perspectives.\nOn one side, the tremendous advantage professionals or students experience by connecting from home is evident. For instance, it assists working individuals in preserving a balance between work and personal life. A prime illustration is a new mother can resume her job while simultaneously caring for her child. Individuals also enjoy desired flexibility regarding working hours. Studying from home is also an appealing choice for students. They save commuting time to universities and can devote that time to their studies. In a bustling city like Tokyo, students squander significant time on commuting. Consequently, the perks of working or studying from home are evident.\nConversely, a segment of society questions the productivity of those choosing to work or study remotely. Numerous employers contend that when an employee works in isolation, they dedicate considerable time to communication via phone or email with peers. This adversely impacts an employee's deliverables. Educators believe students are also affected as they cannot resolve their doubts on study topics promptly. As a result, their academic progress suffers.

To begin with, with comprehensive health education from a young age, children develop positive health habits that can persist into adolescence. For instance, a child taught to maintain a sanitary lifestyle early on is likely to continue this practice as they grow older. Additionally, health education equips individuals, particularly children, with essential knowledge to safeguard themselves against disease risks. Instead of fear or panic, individuals may remain composed if they encounter common ailments like allergies or seasonal illnesses. Numerous diseases that could be easily treated can escalate into severe conditions without proper care. Health education empowers individuals to make appropriate treatment choices for faster recovery.\nPreventive measures contribute to enhancing the overall health status of all citizens. For example, vaccinations ensure that expectant mothers and their infants are shielded from severe infectious diseases such as influenza, smallpox, and rubella. When extensive immunization campaigns are carried out nationwide, the community's health significantly improves. Since human resources are crucial for a nation's progress, allocating funds to enhance overall health is an entirely sound decision. Moreover, because treatment expenses are generally much higher than those for prevention, the government can significantly reduce the nation's healthcare expenditure.\nTo sum up, I firmly believe that we should prioritize health education and preventive measures over treatment.

Favorable weather and a smaller population contribute to better health in a small town. Additionally, Small towns are less congested and have lighter traffic. Residing in areas with minimal air and noise pollution promotes a healthier life, resulting in reduced stress and increased happiness. Furthermore, Food and other essentials are generally healthier in small towns, with access to fresh produce. With few exceptions, It's clear that small town living is healthier than life in large cities.\nIn the second place, An additional benefit of small towns is the cost of living. The cost of living is a crucial concern for many, and it's lower in small towns compared to big cities. As a result, In small towns, we can afford spacious homes with beautiful surroundings, and Due to less congestion, there are more facilities and services available.

{"id": "id_563", "input": "In my family, the debate between my parents invariably centers around my father's career choices. Five years ago, he resigned from his two-decade-long position as an architectural engineer to pursue a career in landscape painting. Whenever I inquire about his decision, he earnestly replies, \"I've spent 20 years doing the same work, and it's time to explore something new, that's it.\" Although countless individuals might find it absurd and contend that repetition is the essence of a job, I stand firmly with my father.\nMany workers have embraced repetitive tasks. This approach enables us to accomplish more. My mother, a prominent dentist in our region, has dedicated 25 years to her profession. Gandhi devoted his entire life to opposing the British rule and stirring civil rights movements in India, ultimately earning the title of the nation's father. These instances clearly illustrate that significant accomplishments necessitate a prolonged focus on a single task. Furthermore, when discussing happiness, varied types of jobs can play a pivotal role.\nEngaging in diverse tasks brings greater satisfaction to both employees and employers. Workers employed in conventional companies or industries often grow weary of monotonous tasks. Despite they may become proficient in their roles, shifting jobs contributes to their happiness. Switching work types introduces novelty and taps into their potential to adjust to new settings, which, according to psychological theories, leads to relaxation and happiness. For further illustration, Considering that workers have the capacity to perform various types of work, employers will appreciate the resultant advantages. Both will experience happiness because it's the change of job, not the repetitive daily tasks.\nDifferent tasks throughout the workday introduce more challenges, adding vibrancy to life. Much like a song, life would be dull without challenges. As an engineering researcher, I experience disappointment in failures and excitement in facing new challenges. New challenges from diverse tasks provide more than just additional work; they offer opportunities to gain more knowledge and experience. As a Chinese writer once said, the essence of life's color lies not in cherry blossoms or maple leaves, but in the constant presence of new things and challenges. Ultimately, performing the same task repeatedly only adds to our psychological stress, whereas engaging with diverse jobs adds vibrancy to our lives.\nIn conclusion, I respect my father's decision, although repetition offers chances to become an expert, like my mother, I firmly believe that variety in tasks enriches our lives.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay324", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 567, "to": 610}], "label": "Premise", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 612, "to": 698}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 700, "to": 857}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 899, "to": 973}], "label": "Claim", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 988, "to": 1059}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1061, "to": 1146}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1148, "to": 1241}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1251, "to": 1292}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1294, "to": 1338}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1340, "to": 1514}], "label": "Claim", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1542, "to": 1669}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1671, "to": 1701}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1710, "to": 1764}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1766, "to": 1855}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1857, "to": 1912}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1914, "to": 2023}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2025, "to": 2161}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2163, "to": 2324}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2338, "to": 2474}], "label": "Claim", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2532, "to": 2577}], "label": "Claim", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2617, "to": 2652}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 20}], "edges": [{"source": 3, "target": 0, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 4, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 9, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 7, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 9, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [3, 9, 18, 19, 20]}

This essay aims to delve into these three aspects to substantiate my perspective.\nTo begin with, any innovation that significantly alters our way of life tends to bring about some social challenges. Mobile phones are no exception to this trend. Talking loudly on mobile phones in shared spaces such as schools, libraries, and hospitals is often considered rude and disruptive. Even more concerning, some students exploit mobile phones as cheating devices during exams, using them to exchange answers via text messages. On the brighter side, these challenges can be addressed effectively if proper rules and regulations are put in place.\nAdditionally, it is crucial to highlight that certain health risks linked to mobile phone usage can be severe. Studies have shown that excessive use of electronic devices, including mobile phones, may increase the likelihood of hearing loss and even cancer, although further research is required.\nAnother contentious issue revolves around technological concerns. many individuals are worried that their conversations may be intercepted by unauthorized third parties. this risk persists constantly. However, developing a safer and more advanced system could help safeguard users' private data.\nFurthermore, the mobile phone has evolved into an indispensable multifunctional device in everyday life. Beyond communication, it serves as a web browser, music player, personal organizer, and much more.\nIn summary, excessive use of anything inevitably leads to drawbacks.

When compared to other leisure activities like attending the theater or sporting events, it is a highly economical pastime that provides viewers with numerous indirect experiences.

Individuals with favorite shows often become engrossed when these shows are broadcast. Consequently, they are unable to schedule outings or meet up with family or friends at that time since they perceive these programs as vital to their lives. For instance, one of my friends once postponed a basketball game with me just to watch the popular show \"Infinite Challenges\". This situation affects not only our basketball games but also our friendship, which relies on our regular interactions and conversations. In other words, by choosing to watch television alone at home, my friend missed the chance to strengthen our bond.\nAdditionally, even when people watch TV together, it doesn't provide an opportunity for conversation. Watching a TV show together is not significantly different from watching it alone. Therefore, watching television is not beneficial for fostering a sense of closeness. To further explain my point, it has been reported that most people do not engage in conversation with their family while watching TV together.

Conversely, many support multiple shorter breaks throughout the year, allowing students to rejuvenate at regular intervals. In both situations, students find relief. Nevertheless, I believe that multiple shorter breaks are beneficial for keeping students engaged in their studies..\nTo begin with, Having several breaks spread throughout the year helps lower students' stress levels.. Many educational institutions plan these short vacations right after term exams, providing students with relief from exam stress.. On the other hand, Research conducted by universities shows improvements in students' performance when they receive regular breaks from their academic routines.. Several colleges abroad offer breaks after each semester, allowing students to relax and gear up for the next one.. Furthermore, These frequent holidays enable students to enjoy themselves and gather necessary resources like books and reference materials for upcoming courses..\nIn addition, scientific studies have provided numerous credible surveys on student performance post-break. These studies indicate that Students' ability to learn is enhanced after a refreshing vacation.. For example, At my school, we used to have several breaks following our quarterly exams.. During those breaks, I would review my exam performance and revisit questions or concepts to avoid repeating mistakes.. I also spent time developing hobbies or learning new sports or games.. During every vacation, I would miss school, which fueled my eagerness to start the new term with a strong desire to learn and achieve high marks..\nBreaks are necessary not only for students but also for professionals and homemakers..

To begin with, this method serves as a foundational tool in several areas, including note-taking, completing assignments, and composing written work. It helps enhance learners' spelling abilities and addresses challenges related to reading or writing disabilities. With the support of parents or teachers, children can gain valuable benefits from practicing handwriting. This form of writing encourages children to focus more on content, elaborate thoroughly, and refine their organizational skills.\nAdditionally, parents and educators should prioritize teaching handwriting to children because poor handwriting can adversely affect students' academic performance. The reality is that students with weak handwriting skills often struggle to take effective notes and keep up with lessons. This leads to missing information and insufficient details in their work. Furthermore, the rising reliance on sophisticated technology can make students more complacent and less diligent in honing their writing abilities.

However, have you ever considered the possibility that television has undermined communication within families and among friends? I firmly believe this is one of the most damaging effects television has had on our social lives.\nTo begin with, people tend to spend excessive amounts of time watching television, they risk becoming socially detached from others. Take children as an example\u2014they often prioritize watching movies or music shows on television over engaging in activities like attending school or exercising with friends, which can isolate them from their peers. Over time, their friends may exclude them from shared activities or group studies.\nFurthermore, with the rapid improvement in living standards, it has become increasingly common for families to own three or four televisions, one in each room. both parents and children often prefer staying in their own rooms watching TV rather than engaging in meaningful conversations with each other. As a result, children are more likely to adopt behaviors they observe on television rather than learning them from their parents. Additionally, parents are unable to provide the necessary guidance and care for their children. This leads to a situation where family communication suffers significantly as a result.\nFinally, excessive television consumption can unconsciously lead people to adopt harmful behaviors that contribute to societal divisions. For instance, when children watch films featuring terrorists, they might start viewing terrorism as acceptable behavior. What if children begin imitating the actions of terrorists depicted in Hollywood films? Could this be one of the factors contributing to divisions in society?\nIn summary, although television does have its positive aspects, it has significantly disrupted communication among family members and friends.

The debate surrounding whether universities should ensure an equal intake of male and female students in their courses remains ongoing. Nonetheless, given the equal significance of both genders, it is essential they are provided with the same opportunities. Universities should ensure a balanced admission of males and females, aligned with their preferences.\nAccess to education is a fundamental right for both males and females. There is a global emphasis on empowering women, which underscores the necessity of women should be afforded the same opportunities as men. If universities admit males and females equally, it will allow them to hone their skills while fostering a constructive competitive atmosphere.\nCo-education facilitates mutual understanding and interaction between genders. It equips them with essential skills to collaborate, interact, and coexist harmoniously. For instance, students from all-boys institutions often lack the ability to interact effectively with females. Conversely, similarly, girls from single-gender colleges may feel overly self-conscious around boys. Co-education can address and eliminate such shortcomings in both genders. Providing equal opportunities in universities equips both genders to face future challenges and benefits society in the long term.\nRegrettably, there exist some men who believe women lack competence in fields like mathematics, mechanical engineering, and defense. Such gender-biased perspectives hinder societal progress. Time and again, women have consistently demonstrated their capabilities across various domains. Figures like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, and Marie Curie exemplify the brilliance and expertise of women.\nHence, I strongly advocate that both genders deserve equal opportunities, and universities should maintain a balanced intake of males and females. Promoting gender equality in education contributes to societal advancement. Both genders are integral to society, and neither holds superiority over the other.

{"id": "id_579", "input": "Many individuals assert that music should be a core subject in high school, while others argue that it is dispensable and should be optional at best. In this essay, I will explore both perspectives.\nIt is evident that music possesses a powerful ability to positively impact human psychology. Consequently, numerous universities offer music courses to their students so that they study and live harmoniously with music. I am inclined to believe that students who dedicate much of their time to various academic subjects should have avenues to alleviate school-related stress. In this scenario, music can serve as an effective and engaging solution. Furthermore, when musical activities involve multiple participants, it fosters teamwork and cooperation, which are advantageous in their futures. Indeed, students with weaker academic performance can excel in music. As a result, a serene classroom environment might be established.\nOn the other hand, it is apparent that music can mentally benefit students in various ways. In our fast-paced lives, however, the demand is not for students with musical orientation, but for those with strong academic credentials. Therefore, I concur with the majority, because music is an art form that demands a particular mindset. Increasingly, however, students cannot experience the expected benefits unless they engage with music more earnestly. Thus, music and other leisure subjects should be elective. Today, with life's accelerated pace, time has become life's most precious commodity. In my opinion, students should prioritize developing professional skills through career-related subjects rather than indulging in playing guitar or singing.\nTo sum up, I believe that to thrive in a competitive job market, students must possess advanced knowledge in their respective fields.

It is indisputable that CCTV usage offers numerous advantages, particularly in curbing criminal activities and safeguarding employees at their workplaces. However, there are those who contend that these cameras infringe upon their privacy due to constant observation. Despite this, I firmly assert that CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to address the rising theft rate and to ensure the safety of employees at the workplace.\nTo begin with, having CCTV cameras at the workplace can help reduce crimes like theft. This is because when a store is targeted by burglars, footage from these cameras can serve as evidence to track down the culprits. To further illustrate, in Malaysia, law enforcement utilized CCTV footage to locate and apprehend a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop at midnight. Additionally, employees are less inclined to steal from shops when they know they are continuously being watched. Therefore, it is evident that CCTVs should be installed in all workplaces to help lower crime rates.\nMoreover, in certain offices, employees frequently face irate or upset customers. Occasionally, direct interactions with a displeased customer might pose physical threats to the employee. Consequently, CCTV camera installation can assist employees in avoiding such scenarios because customers are aware that their exchanges are being recorded. During disputes, the recorded videos can be used to ascertain the actual events and take appropriate measures. In summary, these cameras can offer a level of protection to employees against customers.\nFrom a different angle, the deployment of CCTV cameras does stir debate. Critics of CCTV systems argue that their privacy is breached due to constant surveillance. Nonetheless, it is crucial to understand that safety holds greater significance than privacy, and prevention outweighs enduring the aftermath. As a result, those opposed to this system should aim to grasp the situation and take precautions against becoming crime victims.\nIn conclusion, CCTV cameras are vital and thus should be installed in every premise. Primarily, this is to protect oneself from potential harm by intruders or thieves. Although, privacy is compromised with the implementation of these cameras.

From my perspective, even though protecting endangered animals is crucial, the needs of humans should take precedence.\nFirstly, the population is growing every day, so the demand for food is also on the rise. We require farmland to cultivate crops like wheat and corn, and undeniably, without food, people cannot survive for more than a few weeks. Thus, farmlands are essential for human survival.\nSecondly, individuals need shelters to protect themselves from natural elements such as wind, floods, and wild animals, so land is necessary for constructing homes. Housing is one of the most fundamental human requirements after food, which is undeniable.\nFinally, humans require essential items to sustain life, many of which are industrial, like medicine.

{"id": "id_583", "input": "When selecting a career, it's essential to deliberate carefully. People have varied perspectives on whether to pursue a job similar to that of their parents. Personally, I believe that opting for a career similar to one's parents can enhance one's professional journey. \nFirstly, since parents are immersed in the same field, they can offer substantial support to their children, including expert knowledge and industry insights. For instance, my father is a software developer, and he has indeed imparted significant programming skills and computer knowledge to me. Whenever I encountered a challenge, I would consult him for advice. Since he possesses a wealth of experience, I am able to save a great deal of time in finding solutions. This undeniably gives me an edge over my peers. Had I pursued a different field than my father, I would have encountered greater challenges than I currently do.\nHowever, because parents have been active in the industry for decades, they have built a vast network within a specific sector. They possess deep insights into the field and can provide considerable support to their offspring. For example, they are aware of which companies offer better benefits or educational opportunities. Furthermore, their colleagues in the same field might even assist by drafting recommendation letters for specific companies. It is undeniable that a strong recommendation letter holds significant value in today's competitive world. While others are still busy crafting their resumes, someone with a solid recommendation letter has already advanced past the initial interview phase. \nSome might contend that as times change, the job market conditions have changed drastically. Thus, selecting a career similar to one's parents' may not always be the right choice. While I partially agree with this view, when it comes to predicting trends, no one can be consistently accurate. The job market's dynamics shift rapidly and unpredictably, making it hard to ensure it's impossible to foresee any job remaining in demand for 30 years or more.\nIn weighing whether to choose a job akin to one's parents', I have outlined several reasons why individuals can receive more support from their parents if they work in the same industry.

Students gain insights from various other sources like personal experiences, libraries, and interactions with others. I believe attending lectures should be made optional for students for the reasons outlined below.\nTo begin with, a key reason why university students shouldn't be compelled to attend lectures is that students often find that they can learn more effectively from resources outside the traditional classroom setting. Students have the option to independently study in libraries, concentrating solely on the topics they find challenging. For instance, I had a close friend who was in the same academic department as I was during university. She grasped concepts quickly and comprehended classroom material with remarkable speed. Consequently, she seldom attended lectures, instead dedicating her time to mastering difficult topics. Ultimately, she graduated with excellent grades.\nAdditionally, students should not be mandated to attend lectures because students can allocate the time they would spend in classes to pursue other beneficial activities if they have already mastered the lecture material. From my personal experience, there were numerous occasions when I skipped biology classes because my university did not enforce mandatory attendance. Moreover, I had pre-studied all biology topics before enrolling in university. Consequently, I utilized the time allocated for biology classes to work on my Chemistry research, achieving an A+ in both subjects.\nIn summary, I am of the opinion that students should be adept at identifying the most appropriate activities for their time and effectively managing their study schedules.

Nonetheless, some advocate for governmental controls to curb their expressions. Personally, I agree with this notion only partially and hold that artists should be granted freedom to produce outstanding masterpieces.\nTo begin with, imposing restrictions on artists' ideas may gradually lead to a decline in their creativity. It's unquestionable that when allowed to express themselves, many artists will think innovatively and create remarkable artworks like paintings or films. For instance, artworks by Da Vinci and Michelangelo remain revered to this day because they were not subjected to restrictions during their time. In summary, without constraints, artists will deliver more breathtaking creations.\nMoreover, it is a fundamental human right to express opinions freely, provided it doesn't cause harm to the nation. Today, many nations strive to portray themselves as democratic. Art can be a powerful medium to critique social issues and government policies within a country. To further illustrate, the renowned film '3 Idiots', featuring Aamir Khan, criticizes the education system for emphasizing rote learning over practical application. Hence, denying artists the freedom to express their emotions freely infringes on human rights.\nFrom a different viewpoint, there are certain disadvantages if artists aren't regulated. They might delve into sensitive topics that could spark controversies within a nation. For example, Malaysia is a diverse nation where citizens coexist peacefully and harmoniously. If anyone addresses sensitive racial issues in their films or books, it might lead to societal unrest. However, I assert that artists are aware of their limits and would not want to tarnish their reputation through reckless actions.\nIn conclusion, it's now clear that artists' work should not be subject to any restrictions.

{"id": "id_590", "input": "There has been extensive discussion regarding the significance of having good roommates and the impact they can have on our lives during school. Studies indicate that friendships formed at university often become lifelong connections, particularly with roommates. From my perspective, the most crucial attribute of roommates is being considerate. Concurrently, effective communication is another vital trait of a good roommate. \nConsideration always plays a key role in relationships. For instance, a considerate roommate lowers the music or TV volume at night. Occasionally, we don't realize our actions until we experience the consequences ourselves. Consistently considering the feelings of others before acting selfishly can greatly enhance the roommate relationship. Consequently, having a thoughtful roommate is extremely essential to our academic life. It not only helps in avoiding disputes but also fosters friendships or even familial bonds.\nAdditionally, communication equally contributes to being a good roommate. Individuals have varying habits, like making the bed each morning. While some may find this simple, others might see it as a daunting task. Demanding to move out merely because a roommate doesn't tidy the bed might be an overreaction. Thus, communication holds immense importance since it helps to eliminate misunderstandings. Through communication, bonds are formed, and mutual understanding is enhanced.\nIn summary, roommates offer numerous valuable qualities that hold great importance. I believe that the most essential qualities are consideration and communication. Nevertheless, it's not always possible to have everything we desire.

They should consistently nurture their enthusiasm for their area of expertise so that they can continuously advance themselves. Subsequently, they are able to enhance their teaching capabilities. For example, the most remarkable professor during my university years was Mr. Yang, who was dedicated to research and reading. He inspired us and taught us how to study more efficiently on our own. All my classmates rated him AAA, an outstanding educator.\nStudents can acquire knowledge from textbooks, websites, or instructors. However, but we rely on professors when seeking to engage in research and enhance our skills. If a professor is not involved in research activities, they cannot offer us such opportunities. Moreover, a professor devoted to research is constantly generating and exploring new ideas. They can inspire us as students to propose innovative ideas. This benefits both the professor and the students.\nUltimately, professors in universities are invaluable assets to society. They lead in nearly every domain, including science, arts, and culture. Without their research, the rapid emergence of new technologies would be hindered. Without their research, more artistic creations would be lost to oblivion.

Yet, finding the ideal community that fulfills all our criteria can be challenging. In my hometown, most public utilities cater to people's needs, except for transportation. Therefore, what I really wish to change is the introduction of more public transportation options. Considering I encounter traffic jams every single day. And this issue seems to be worsening. \nInitially, there should be additional options for public transportation, like a subway or a sky train. As a result, people would have multiple ways to reach their destinations. Given that currently, buses are the sole form of public transportation in this area, This situation leaves residents without alternatives. They are compelled to rely solely on buses to travel elsewhere. Introducing a subway and sky train would significantly enhance convenience for them. For instance, people can predict travel times using subway schedules. Conversely, this is not possible with buses. Additionally, such an enhancement would indirectly alleviate road congestion. \nMoreover, buses only provide two routes within this community. This is undoubtedly a significant issue. For example, if my intended destination isn't on a bus route, I must first travel to the central station and switch to another bus. Clearly, this process is time-consuming. Increasing the number of routes would facilitate easier transportation for residents.\nFinally, expanding public transportation options can reduce the reliance on personal vehicles. Furthermore, it presents numerous benefits. For example, individuals can cut down on fuel costs, which are rising. Essential energy resources will be consumed at a slower rate, because people use their personal vehicles less frequently. \nIn conclusion, transportation is a fundamental factor that directly influences people's quality of life.

Consequently, it is vital to switch from cars to other transportation modes and to enact legislation to regulate car usage.\nSecondly, more cars on the road result in severe traffic jams. when caught in traffic, we end up wasting a significant amount of time. Furthermore, traffic jams frustrate drivers, leading to an increase in traffic accidents. Hence, strategies to reduce car numbers and control car ownership and usage should be devised and executed without delay.\nTo address these issues, alternative transportation options and international rules governing car ownership and usage can be highly effective. Concerning the first point, alternative modes that produce less carbon dioxide and other gases than cars are ideal. For instance, a bicycle rental system has been implemented in various European nations. This system allows people to rent bicycles at district corners and ride them to other areas for a small fee. Since bicycles emit no carbon dioxide or harmful gases, they are a superior option for environmental protection compared to cars. Regarding the second point, introducing international regulations can also be beneficial. For example, certain laws limit car usage during specific times and allow individuals to own only one car. Consequently, these initiatives to decrease car numbers could alleviate traffic jams and reduce environmental pollution.\nIn conclusion, although some people argue for the convenience of cars, I contend that alternative transport solutions and international automobile regulations are essential for protecting the environment and easing traffic congestion.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay031", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 260, "to": 372}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 461, "to": 532}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 545, "to": 624}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 626, "to": 716}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 732, "to": 840}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 852, "to": 903}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 905, "to": 975}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 990, "to": 1065}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1074, "to": 1187}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1214, "to": 1330}], "label": "Claim", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1360, "to": 1446}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1462, "to": 1534}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1536, "to": 1643}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1651, "to": 1699}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1701, "to": 1773}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1803, "to": 1863}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1878, "to": 1970}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1986, "to": 2091}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2117, "to": 2162}], "label": "Claim", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2179, "to": 2326}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 19}], "edges": [{"source": 3, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 4, 8, 9, 18, 19]}
{"id": "id_597", "input": "In today's fast-paced and complex world, where everything seems hurried and competitive, stress has become a common issue for many. As a result, people are constantly seeking ways to alleviate their stress. There are numerous activities that can help individuals manage their stress effectively. I believe that engaging in activities such as listening to music, playing sports, and practicing meditation are straightforward and effective methods for stress reduction.\nTo begin with, music provides a wonderful way to unwind. For instance, during my daily commute to work, I use public transportation. I encounter various stress-inducing situations such as traffic congestion, crowded bus stops, and packed buses. These scenarios contribute to my stress levels. Therefore, I consistently listen to music on my mp3 player. I can enjoy music without being concerned about the surrounding people. As a result, Listening to music brings me happiness.\nSecondly, exercise is another universally effective method for alleviating stress. For example, my mind is often occupied with work-related challenges and deadlines that must be met. These worries sometimes disrupt my sleep, leaving me stressed. Hence, I make it a habit to exercise after work, with jogging being my preferred activity. After exercising, I find it easier to fall asleep. Exercise not only diminishes my stress but also enhances my physical health.\nThirdly, meditation is another effective stress-reduction technique. When overwhelmed by numerous thoughts that trigger stress, I turn to meditation. Meditation offers a simple way to unwind because it requires no special equipment and only takes a few minutes. To meditate, I simply sit down, close my eyes, and focus on my breathing. This practice helps alleviate my stress. \nIn summary, there are multiple strategies to combat stress. From my perspective, listening to music, exercising, and practicing meditation are the top activities people can engage in to relieve stress. These methods are easy to implement and highly practical. Everyone should make time to engage in these activities more frequently to improve their physical and mental well-being.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay282", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 311, "to": 466}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 483, "to": 523}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 772, "to": 819}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 821, "to": 891}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 906, "to": 944}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 956, "to": 1027}], "label": "Claim", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1199, "to": 1281}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1283, "to": 1332}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1334, "to": 1409}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1420, "to": 1478}], "label": "Claim", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1561, "to": 1601}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1610, "to": 1671}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1673, "to": 1745}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1747, "to": 1786}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1870, "to": 1989}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1991, "to": 2047}], "label": "Claim", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2049, "to": 2168}], "label": "Claim", "id": 16}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 5, 9, 14, 15, 16]}
{"id": "id_598", "input": "Luck has undeniably brought some people things beyond their wildest dreams on several occasions. Nevertheless, I find it irrational to rely on luck for achieving one's objectives. As a result, I firmly support the idea that dedicated effort is the true driver that enables individuals to accomplish their ambitions.\nTo begin with, putting all your trust in luck for achieving success is a gamble with significant risks. Luck is an abstract concept, and there is no certainty it will ever favor you. If luck does not come through, the resulting frustration can be overwhelming. On the contrary, hard work, on the other hand, can at least bring you closer to your desired outcome. Reflecting on my own experiences, every success I have achieved has been a direct result of my effort rather than sheer luck. Furthermore, I have consistently avoided the disappointment of failing to meet my goals.\nSecondly, embracing the belief that hard work is the true path to success transforms you into a forward-thinking individual. Put simply, individuals who prioritize hard work possess a clear sense of direction and understand their ultimate aspirations. They meticulously plan their journey toward success and regularly assess their progress until their goals are achieved. Conversely, a reliance on luck leaves one uncertain about their trajectory. For instance, a friend of mine, despite facing severe financial difficulties, habitually purchased lottery tickets in the hope of winning one day. He lived under the illusion that a lottery win would solve all his monetary problems. Yet, Even today, his luck has not materialized, and his financial troubles have only deepened.\nThirdly, when you put in effort, luck might align with your actions and propel you even further toward your goals. For example, my employer exerted relentless effort to earn his promotion. He thoroughly analyzed the qualifications required to secure the promotion. He identified that obtaining a master's degree would give him a competitive edge over others. Although Despite juggling numerous responsibilities at work and home, he managed to complete the degree before applying. Ultimately, not only did he achieve the promotion amidst stiff competition, but he was also nominated for an overseas scholarship because his qualifications surpassed those of others in similar positions.\nWhile being fortunate is undoubtedly advantageous, placing excessive dependence on luck is unwise. Therefore, I firmly advocate for hard work, as it minimizes the disappointments that often accompany reliance on luck.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay203", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 111, "to": 178}], "label": "Claim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 224, "to": 314}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 331, "to": 418}], "label": "Claim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 420, "to": 497}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 499, "to": 575}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 594, "to": 677}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 713, "to": 803}], "label": "Claim", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 818, "to": 892}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1031, "to": 1144}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1146, "to": 1264}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1266, "to": 1340}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1356, "to": 1487}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1489, "to": 1573}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1580, "to": 1668}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1679, "to": 1783}], "label": "Claim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1798, "to": 1857}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1859, "to": 1933}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1935, "to": 2027}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2038, "to": 2148}], "label": "Premise", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2150, "to": 2279}], "label": "Premise", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2288, "to": 2353}], "label": "Premise", "id": 20}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2361, "to": 2404}], "label": "Premise", "id": 21}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2406, "to": 2452}], "label": "Claim", "id": 22}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2465, "to": 2571}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 23}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 18, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 19, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 19, "target": 20, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 22, "target": 21, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 14, 22, 23]}

The following sections provide reasons for this viewpoint.\nTo begin with, not everyone has the opportunity to travel abroad to learn a foreign language because doing so entails significant expenses and numerous legal procedures. In the past, finding a teacher to learn a foreign language was challenging. However, globalization has made it much easier to find language instructors domestically. For instance, in the Indian subcontinent, numerous centers have been established to offer training in various languages such as French and German.\nFurthermore, many colleges and universities now include foreign language courses in their curricula. students have the option to select from a range of languages offered by their university. Therefore, learning a foreign language at home has become quite convenient. Moreover, highly skilled foreign language educators are readily available in many educational institutions.\nAdditionally, technology has significantly diminished the barriers to acquiring a foreign language domestically. numerous online foreign language courses exist, along with forums where individuals can discuss language-related challenges.\nIn conclusion, learning a foreign language in one's home country is the preferred option. it is economical and there are now ample opportunities to achieve this goal.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay299", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 318, "to": 409}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 485, "to": 562}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 571, "to": 638}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 640, "to": 714}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 725, "to": 804}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 820, "to": 951}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 966, "to": 1052}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1054, "to": 1142}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1155, "to": 1218}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1230, "to": 1326}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1342, "to": 1439}], "label": "Claim", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1441, "to": 1564}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1581, "to": 1654}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1656, "to": 1731}], "label": "Claim", "id": 13}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 4, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 4, 8, 10, 12, 13]}

Many believe these qualities are primarily acquired through academic institutions. I partially agree with this viewpoint. However, I maintain that individuals can also thrive without attending universities.\nTo begin with, university education is undeniably critical for certain careers like doctors, engineers, and lawyers. Without adequate training and expertise, it would be challenging for them to excel in their professions. Moreover, during their time at university, they can share knowledge and form business networks. This networking can be advantageous when they decide to launch their own firms or clinics.\nFrom a different angle, there are numerous individuals who achieve remarkable success without attending university. Consider those who initiate their own enterprises. These entrepreneurs rely entirely on diligence and fortune. Interestingly, for some, this has turned out to be a lucrative pursuit. For example, Michael Dell, the founder and CEO of Dell, left college at the age of 19. Initially, he launched his computer business from his college dormitory. Eventually, he utilized his profits and a family loan to evolve into the person he is today.\nAdditionally, individuals possessing innate talents are also likely to succeed in life.

{"id": "id_602", "input": "In recent times, it has become increasingly common for educators to integrate technological tools into the learning environment. Nonetheless, I do not agree that this surge in technology will revolutionize the educational system by substituting teachers with computers.\nThere are multiple reasons why computers can never replace teachers. To start with, computers require human operation. It is indisputable that technological tools are essential in today's classrooms. For instance, Lessons become more engaging and easier to comprehend when presented via PowerPoint and displayed using an LCD projector. However, Researchers confirm that trained personnel are necessary in every classroom to employ these interactive and innovative teaching methods. While I acknowledge that computers significantly enhance the learning process today, they are merely aids for teachers and cannot function effectively without human involvement.\nFurthermore, children require human interaction. Regardless of technological advancements, it's evident that a computer will never be able to engage in communication with students. As highlighted in a recent interview with Josh Trumm, founder of the 'Teachers Global Group,' human interactions cannot be replicated by computers: 'This verbal and non-verbal communication between teachers and students is the foundational step towards a proper education'. Without someone to explain and understand their challenges, students cannot genuinely learn'.

To help students adapt swiftly to societal norms, it is advisable for parents to motivate them to take part-time employment.

This is because the majority of individuals they interact with are fellow students. Yet, engaging in part-time work allows students to collaborate with a variety of people, most of whom are adults. Consequently, these adults can impart valuable lessons regarding adult life to students. My friend Lisa, currently working part-time, shares that the experience is incredibly rewarding. Through her part-time job, she has formed friendships with diverse individuals, exposing her to various facets of adult life. For instance, Initially, Lisa believed work was central to adult life; however, her new acquaintances have shifted her perspective to recognize that responsibility is the true essence. As a result, with the insights her new friends have shared; she now feels more assured about her future adult life. \nMoreover, parents frequently remind students that adult life is far more demanding than school life. Nonetheless, due to the fact that without firsthand experience, it is challenging to comprehend the intensity of adult life. Thus, part-time employment is necessary to teach us about the challenges of real adult life. In reality, surveys show that students who have engaged in part-time work tend to optimize their time for future preparation and, importantly, have realistic expectations compared to those who haven't. Hence, part-time jobs provide insights into understanding future life.\nAdditionally, some parents worry that part-time work might interfere with students' academic pursuits. In fact, most students opt for part-time jobs during holidays, therefore thus, it doesn't affect their studies. Rather than spending holidays on computers, part-time work is a superior alternative for students.\nIn summary, participating in part-time jobs enables students to experience and learn more about genuine adult life.

Therefore, the jury must consider the circumstances under which a crime was committed. For instance, for example, if someone kills in self-defense, such an act is not deemed egregious. Only those who commit vile acts with full awareness are eligible for the death penalty.\nThe death penalty is vital for controlling societal violence. I am convinced that individuals such as psychopaths, terrorists, or any criminals devoid of empathy for human life warrant the death penalty. The death penalty effectively upholds human rights. Nevertheless, it should be regarded as a measure of last resort by the jury, with all circumstances carefully evaluated prior to delivering the final judgment.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay059", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 270, "to": 359}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 361, "to": 438}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 440, "to": 501}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 503, "to": 627}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 643, "to": 710}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 726, "to": 806}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 808, "to": 930}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 945, "to": 995}], "label": "Claim", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1012, "to": 1124}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1126, "to": 1254}], "label": "Claim", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1261, "to": 1290}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1292, "to": 1349}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1351, "to": 1452}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1454, "to": 1539}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1555, "to": 1637}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1639, "to": 1725}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1727, "to": 1787}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1809, "to": 1929}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1931, "to": 1981}], "label": "Claim", "id": 18}], "edges": [{"source": 4, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 13, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 13, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 4, 7, 9, 12, 16, 17, 18]}

Conversely, there are others who prefer a different outcome. Personally, I enjoy seeing deserving characters being celebrated. Nonetheless, it seems inappropriate if good characters always have a happy ending.\nFirstly, when every story concludes in the same manner, it becomes monotonous. If virtuous characters consistently triumph, the conclusion becomes predictable. This predictability diminishes our interest. Conversely, if goodness isn't always rewarded, we are compelled to watch till the end to uncover the resolution. For instance, Hollywood narratives often conclude with a hero defeating adversity and winning the affection of a partner. Yet, many, myself included, have grown weary of such outcomes. I am uninterested in witnessing the same ending repeatedly. Therefore, we should not always depict virtuous characters receiving rewards in films or television shows.\nIn reality, good individuals sometimes experience unfortunate outcomes. And I believe This occurs more frequently in real life than in cinematic portrayals. Thus, children who constantly view shows where good characters are rewarded might believe this reflects real life. These films can create misconceptions. Also, They might behave virtuously solely to receive rewards. Once they realize that good deeds don't always lead to rewards, they might become disheartened and abandon virtuous behavior. However, in reality, Individuals continue to perform good deeds regardless of the outcome. So We should communicate this to young viewers to prevent misconceptions.\nIndeed, Occasionally, happy endings can be beneficial. Some might feel inspired to perform good deeds.

In contrast to this widespread notion, some still hold the perspective that opting for classes gives students the chance to study from home, thereby avoiding the time-consuming commute and saving money. Nonetheless, I am inclined to think that attending classes appears to be a more prudent choice.\nFirstly, I firmly believe that being present in classes offers students the chance to interact with peers, which is valuable for grasping new concepts by discussing them during free periods at college. Furthermore, students can assist one another in understanding the materials more effectively. Conversely, those who skip classes miss out on the opportunity to benefit from peer support in tackling challenging topics. \nAnother crucial point to bear in mind is that with teachers' guidance, students can grasp ideas more swiftly and effortlessly because teachers provide detailed explanations in class and follow up with numerous examples to clarify the concepts. thus, attending classes not only saves time but also enhances the learning process, making comprehension quicker compared to self-study. \nEqually important is the fact that being present in class instills a sense of responsibility in students because students must adhere to classroom rules, fostering perseverance in completing their assignments. However, those who opt to study at home lack structured study habits and struggle to enforce a consistent study schedule.

{"id": "id_618", "input": "What comes to mind when you see a stunning building or an airport? Do you believe they came into existence by mere chance? Certainly not. Similarly, it's absurd to think that global networks like Google or Yahoo were created by sheer luck. Although some individuals attribute many successes to luck, I must disagree with this viewpoint. Let me elaborate on the main reasons for my stance.\nFirstly, renowned individuals are typically hardworking, not merely lucky. Diligence makes one an expert in their field, which is a strength in their profession. In essence, putting in hard work minimizes the element of chance in achieving success. Take, for instance, in football, it's often said that scoring from a penalty requires some luck. Statistically, the odds of scoring are fifty-fifty. However, Ronaldo is more likely to score from a penalty than I am. This isn't because Ronaldo is luckier. Clearly, Undoubtedly, it's due to his extensive practice and training. He trains rigorously on the football field every day, therefore not because he has more luck than I do.\nFurthermore, we cannot rely solely on luck to achieve success. While I acknowledge luck can play a role, it's rarely a constant companion. For example, consider when when preparing for TOEFL or another multiple-choice test with four options per question. You can't prepare without studying and just depend on luck, even if you're very fortunate. Randomly guessing answers would likely result in failing the exam. Without a doubt, It's prudent to study diligently to succeed in an exam.\nLastly, you must work hard to acquire knowledge and information before successfully completing a project. Even the luckiest individuals cannot build a car or construct a skyscraper purely by chance. These tasks are completed by those who have mastered their craft. Undoubtedly, such individuals work tirelessly and gain significant experience through their efforts.\nIn summary, I believe any major success requires substantial effort, not just good fortune, even though luck is one element in achieving goals, yet its influence is secondary, and we shouldn't depend on luck in our planning.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay257", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 398, "to": 462}], "label": "Claim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 464, "to": 549}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 563, "to": 636}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 658, "to": 733}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 735, "to": 785}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 787, "to": 852}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 854, "to": 891}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 902, "to": 962}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 964, "to": 1016}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1028, "to": 1066}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1081, "to": 1129}], "label": "Claim", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1131, "to": 1205}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1234, "to": 1321}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1323, "to": 1412}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1414, "to": 1479}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1498, "to": 1552}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1562, "to": 1658}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1660, "to": 1751}], "label": "Claim", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1753, "to": 1817}], "label": "Premise", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1832, "to": 1918}], "label": "Premise", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1942, "to": 2010}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 20}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2024, "to": 2062}], "label": "Claim", "id": 21}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2068, "to": 2143}], "label": "Premise", "id": 22}], "edges": [{"source": 0, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 0, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 0, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 5, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 3, "target": 6, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 17, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 17, "target": 18, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 17, "target": 19, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 21, "target": 22, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 10, 17, 20, 21]}
{"id": "id_619", "input": "In our daily interactions, we meet various individuals and hear differing opinions about ourselves or our work, whether positive or negative. While accepting compliments can be straightforward, handling criticism may be challenging. Thus, it is important to note that those unable to accept criticism from others are unlikely to thrive in collaborative settings. Personally, I concur with this view.\nFirstly, the essence of teamwork lies in reaching a \"consensus\". It is the notion that everyone's perspective holds value. Within group tasks, members convene to brainstorm, evaluate all potential solutions, and ultimately come to a mutual agreement. Throughout this extensive discussion process, diverse opinions are bound to emerge. The process fails when one individual clings solely to their idea, ignoring the constructive feedback from others because the outcome is collectively owned, not a stage for one person's solo act. Each participant is obliged to value others' viewpoints.\nSecondly, embracing criticism is a commendable trait as it involves considering viewpoints that challenge your own. Criticism is important to embrace, even outside of group work. Facing criticism can indeed be painful because it highlights your weaknesses and compels you to address them. However, criticism can be beneficial in identifying and correcting flaws if you are open to it. Those who reject all forms of criticism will eventually miss opportunities for improvement. Put differently, being unable to handle criticism can hinder both collaboration and personal endeavors. As a Chinese saying suggests: \"Bitter medicine has the best healing properties\". Criticism may be a potent remedy for improvement.\nYet, some might question: what if the criticism turns out to be incorrect? What if my initial stance was correct, but the seemingly reasonable criticism led me astray? Isn't persistence also a valuable trait? From my perspective, criticism remains advantageous even if you are initially correct because in such instances, it not only serves as a corrective tool but also tests your understanding of your work. Accepting criticism doesn't imply you must agree with all of it. You should also exercise your own discernment! Mastering the art of leveraging criticism effectively is an essential skill.\nIn conclusion, criticism is vital in teamwork, and it remains crucial in other contexts as well. It's akin to a critical mirror reflecting our flaws, enabling us to strive towards becoming more refined and self-assured.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay251", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 268, "to": 361}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 409, "to": 463}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 465, "to": 521}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 523, "to": 649}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 735, "to": 848}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 857, "to": 929}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 931, "to": 986}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 998, "to": 1102}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1104, "to": 1165}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1167, "to": 1205}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1214, "to": 1275}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1286, "to": 1371}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1373, "to": 1463}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1482, "to": 1567}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1569, "to": 1648}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1650, "to": 1698}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1930, "to": 1994}], "label": "Claim", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2003, "to": 2108}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2110, "to": 2173}], "label": "Premise", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2175, "to": 2220}], "label": "Premise", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2222, "to": 2297}], "label": "Premise", "id": 20}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2314, "to": 2394}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 21}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 8, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 11, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 16, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 16, "target": 18, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 16, "target": 19, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 16, "target": 20, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 8, 16, 21]}

After school, students and even non-students will gather at the high school building to participate in various competitions. For example, during a football match, students from different high schools will attend, and after the game, they will maintain contact. This will enhance the social interactions among students. The sole drawback is the noise generated by the competitions. Local residents may find this somewhat bothersome, yet I believe this is not a sufficient reason to halt the competitions.\nIn conclusion, this new development offers numerous benefits, such as fostering new relationships among students from diverse communities, and the modern educational equipment will boost students' enthusiasm for learning.

While some advocate that every student deserves access to education at these levels, I contend that it is more advantageous to reserve this level of education for a select group of proficient and knowledgeable learners.\nPrimarily, concentrating on gifted students is a superior approach because it enables academic institutions to uphold their high standards of education.

Standard jobs will remain accessible to everyone, whereas complex ones should be entrusted to the most capable individuals, who have trained at top institutions.

Additionally, the rise in sea levels, attributed to global warming, poses a significant threat to human life in various countries. Should we persist in emitting carbon dioxide through non-eco-friendly vehicles, countries such as Japan may face submersion, and weather patterns could shift, leading to floods, droughts, and a surge in destructive storms. In essence, our ecosystem is currently in its direst state, and failing to implement stringent measures now means we never will.\nMoreover, investing in environmental protection will ultimately be advantageous for the company. Today, a growing number of individuals are increasingly conscious of conservation; thus, funding conservation efforts proves to be a more effective advertising strategy. Consider if your company-backed initiative significantly enhances the environment, your company would gain a reputation as eco-friendly, which is beneficial in today's consumer-driven market.\nUltimately, environmental conservation elevates our quality of life.

Additionally, there are always individuals who are influenced by ads to buy certain products, setting a trend that others follow despite not genuinely needing them.\nOn the contrary, purchasing habits are highly personal matters for each individual, advertising is not the sole factor prompting people to make purchases, often, it hinges on a person's needs and their financial capacity. adults, who are mindful of managing their disposable income, are less likely to make impulsive purchases. many adults need to budget their money carefully when making additional purchases. Conversely, children and teenagers, who lack financial independence, are more prone to buying impulsively without assessing their real needs, because they don't face financial pressures and lack the ability to discern what is truly necessary.\nPersonally, I believe people's buying habits are ultimately their own choice and not solely influenced by advertisements.

Evidently, with the pace of life accelerating, people endure significant pressure from academics or work, which can be detrimental if not managed. Art and music are among the most accessible means for modern individuals to escape the intense pressures of life. while admiring a masterpiece like the Mona Lisa, individuals can set aside their stress and ponder the meaning behind the world's most enigmatic smile. At this point, they become fully immersed in the world of art, allowing their tensions to ease. Clearly, this appreciation for art stems from foundational studies in the field.\nIt must be acknowledged that learning art and music should be driven by the student's personal interests. art and music education won't be effective if students are unwilling participants.

In my view, setting aside a portion of your earnings is crucial because future events are unpredictable, both professionally and personally, and having savings allows you to achieve some of your aspirations.\nFirstly, many uncertainties exist regarding your career path. In today's challenging global economy, numerous unforeseen factors make it vital to have a financial cushion.

{"id": "id_629", "input": "While some individuals argue that the school curriculum should primarily focus on academics, I firmly assert that the importance of physical education should not be overshadowed. Engaging in physical activities helps cultivate a healthy populace, aids learning through firsthand experience, and ultimately supports a country's economic growth. \nTo begin with, there's an old Latin saying: \"Anima sana in corpore sano,\" signifying that a healthy body is foundational for a healthy mind. There is a clear correlation between individuals' health and the regularity of physical exercise. The more we engage in physical activity, the better our overall well-being. Furthermore, It's evident that regular physical activity can enhance health over time: progressively, we improve our physical condition. Thus, if people start engaging in sports from their school years and continue regularly, it can contribute to building a healthier nation.\nIn addition, through participation in both outdoor and indoor sports, many things become more apparent. For instance, by jogging daily, individuals come to understand their bodies through direct observation. Similarly, school basketball teams learn more effectively about specific techniques through practice rather than theoretical instruction. Moreover, nearly all breakthroughs in natural sciences were achieved through direct observation, a crucial element of physical education. \nFurthermore, the fiscal stability of a region largely relies on the health of its population. For example, investing in physical education programs can reduce healthcare expenses, because the population enjoys relatively good health. In conjunction, individuals who are physically healthy can contribute more significantly to both economic and social progress. Indeed, when a person feels better physically, their cognitive performance improves. Consequently, incorporating physical activities in the early stages of human development will eventually result in a mentally healthy society.

Some individuals attribute tourism to economic imbalances at home, environmental degradation, and irreversible harm to the places it exploits. However, I firmly oppose this misconception for two main reasons.\nFirstly, tourism is crucial in fostering economic growth in the manner intended. Essentially, tourist attractions are often situated in remote areas where the economy hasn't flourished prior to their emergence. Only after companies invest do hotels and service chains begin to emerge. This inevitably draws significant attention, which is accompanied by substantial revenue for the local population. In other words, tourism guides the local economy in the right direction, maximizing its inherent potential.\nSecondly, although environmental damage is unavoidable, tourism should not be held accountable for this. To transform a wilderness into a tourist attraction, planners must have meticulously considered the upkeep of the landscapes. Specifically, for example, a considerable sum is invested in tree pruning, flower watering, and maintaining the balance of local fauna and flora, with the aim of enhancing the natural beauty. Furthermore, ecotourism, an environmentally-friendly service, assists environmentalists and nature enthusiasts in raising awareness about protecting fellow creatures. Consequently, tourism should not be accused of being notorious for harming ecological diversity.\nIn conclusion, tourism has demonstrated its positive approach to the areas it exploits, both financially and environmentally.

Research has demonstrated that with the rising rates of childhood obesity, incorporating daily physical activity would greatly benefit children by providing relief from extended periods of sitting at school. Additionally, exercise can reduce their risk of developing illnesses related to cardiovascular issues, high blood pressure, and cholesterol.\nRegular exercise also plays a role in enhancing children's cognitive functions. It is widely recognized that maintaining a routine of exercise is crucial for optimal bodily functions. Exercise improves the efficiency of the respiratory system, ensuring organs, including the brain, receive increased oxygen. Engaging in daily exercise provides children with a mental break, aiding them in becoming more effective learners.\nIncorporating exercise into children's daily routines from an early age instills the significant value of regular physical activity. Although children receive constant information about nutrition and exercise, practical application of this knowledge is more advantageous. Moreover, this routine can become a lifelong habit, encouraging daily physical activity throughout their lives. \nThe integration of physical activities into the school day for children should be seriously considered.

However, the significance of the written word cannot be overlooked, as it remains a prevalent form of communication. Therefore, I partially concur that, in the modern era, images act as a more compelling medium of communication.\nTo begin with, visuals have the power to shape people's perspectives. For instance, graphic warnings on cigarette packages today depict the harmful effects of smoking. Consequently, data reveals a slight decline in smoking rates, suggesting that individuals are becoming aware of the adverse consequences. Additionally, Kevin Carter's impactful photograph of a malnourished Sudanese child suffering from extreme poverty successfully brought global attention to the struggles of Sudan's population. Moreover, images are extensively featured in newspapers, magazines, and promotional campaigns. Thus, it is undeniable that visuals, even without accompanying text, can captivate a broad audience.\nOn the other hand, written language is equally essential for conveying specific messages. images alone leave room for individual interpretation, leading to varied understandings of their meaning. However, this contrasts with the use of words, which provide clear explanations regarding what the visuals represent. Furthermore, educational methods primarily rely on textual materials. modern academic textbooks integrate both textual descriptions and visuals to enhance comprehension for readers.\nIn conclusion, images and written words complement each other, and emphasizing one over the other would be insufficient.

{"id": "id_635", "input": "In recent times, numerous nations have advanced their economies by enhancing local industries. Yet, there is a concern that industrialized nations might achieve their economic goals at the detriment of ecosystems. From my viewpoint, I believe economic prosperity can coexist with environmental sustainability.\nAdmittedly, certain nations might prioritize economic growth over environmental conservation, leading to environmental degradation. Since these impoverished nations lack sufficient financial and human resources, as well as advanced technology and expertise, they must depend on natural resources to sustain their living conditions. In addition, individuals in economically disadvantaged regions are often not equipped with the knowledge to protect ecosystems. Consequently, uncontrolled and careless exploitation of local natural resources can occur, straining these resources. From this perspective, there can be a tension between economic growth and environmental conservation.\nNevertheless, I am convinced that economic growth can be integrally connected to environmental conservation. As awareness about green economies increases, eco-friendly products are becoming more popular among consumers, which means environmentally conscious businesses can impress customers and boost sales. For instance, electric bicycles powered by clean energy have gained popularity among the public in recent years.\nMoreover, considering environmental impacts can improve operational efficiency. When a company is environmentally aware, it is likely to optimize resource use to enhance production processes and machinery, thereby increasing productivity. Hence, this can stimulate economic growth. Conversely, without environmental conservation mandates, a company might consume excessive energy, significantly contributing to its operational expenses and hindering economic progress.\nIn conclusion, I assert that economic growth and ecosystem preservation can be achieved together.

This sets the optimal conditions for student learning and encourages them to concentrate on their studies rather than squandering time on unproductive activities. Secondly, schools deliver extensive academic knowledge to students. Students have the opportunity to acquire professional skills, broaden their comprehension, and gain valuable experiences. Consequently, they have greater chances to secure employment and achieve success in the future. For instance, it is well-known that employers consistently favor hiring individuals with advanced qualifications and professional expertise.\nOn the other hand, it is not unreasonable for some to argue that children should break away from their academic routines to pursue employment. While children can absorb a lot at school, many subjects they learn might be of minimal relevance to their future. In addition, children can develop social skills through employment. They can acquire experiences that are not attainable within school settings.

Thus, I firmly support the notion that smoking should be banned in restaurants and other public areas, and state laws supporting this prohibition should be endorsed due to the fact that smoking not only harms the atmosphere of the restaurant but also poses a potential risk to the health of others.\nTo begin with, even though it's a bit extreme to claim that smoking should be outlawed everywhere in society, yet smoking in a restaurant signifies enjoying oneself while disregarding the health of others, it is widely accepted that second-hand smoke, emitted from the smoker's mouth, poses an even greater health hazard to those nearby than to the smoker themselves. For instance, when a single person smokes in a restaurant, it involuntarily exposes everyone else to smoke, compromising their health. This occurs because certain burnt substances in cigarettes can easily harm a person's respiratory system upon inhalation. Consequently, smoking in restaurants should be completely banned as it turns the restaurant into a polluted environment endangering all patrons' health.\nMoreover, despite the fact that some patrons are unconcerned about the hazards of second-hand smoke, the offensive smoke can significantly diminish their desire to eat, or in other words, ruin their meals and lead to a negative experience. The smoke released by the smoker often causes discomfort or disgust among others, adversely affecting their dining experience. This can indirectly reduce the restaurant's appeal as fewer individuals are inclined to dine there due to unsatisfactory experiences. \nIn addition, smoking offers no benefits to the smoker themselves. It not only worsens their health, making them more prone to respiratory illnesses, but also tarnishes their public image and reputation. This holds particularly true for well-known political figures or entertainment celebrities, because most people view smoking in restaurants as a rude behavior. At this juncture, the public is likely to perceive the smoker as lacking basic etiquette, deeming them unfit for public leadership. \nIn summary, smoking in a restaurant is a detrimental and disrespectful act. It damages the smoker's reputation and endangers others' health. Hence, it is imprudent to smoke in restaurants and other public venues, and appropriate state laws should be enacted to strictly restrict it.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay214", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 159, "to": 284}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 306, "to": 417}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 446, "to": 623}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 652, "to": 785}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 801, "to": 920}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 942, "to": 1042}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1058, "to": 1108}], "label": "Claim", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1112, "to": 1195}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1298, "to": 1435}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1437, "to": 1562}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1564, "to": 1614}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1618, "to": 1696}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1712, "to": 1763}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1765, "to": 1900}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1902, "to": 1992}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2002, "to": 2060}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2080, "to": 2192}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2207, "to": 2269}], "label": "Claim", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2271, "to": 2334}], "label": "Premise", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2343, "to": 2476}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 19}], "edges": [{"source": 4, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 17, "target": 18, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 6, 8, 12, 17, 19]}

It is evident that some affluent countries and organizations are offering financial help to poorer nations. However, it is disputed that this is the best and sole method to assist developing nations. This argument will be substantiated by examining the importance of enhancing their educational systems and analyzing the true motives of the benefactors.\nFirstly, education is a crucial component in development. For example, many developing nations lack educational resources like experienced teachers, evaluation systems, and teaching facilities, which local authorities often overlook. This example clearly illustrates that without developed countries sharing their educational success stories, developing nations will remain stagnant, even with substantial economic aid. Therefore, the key approach to enhancing the situation in impoverished nations is to assist them in establishing a comprehensive educational system instead of merely providing financial support.\nMoreover, it is commonly recognized that nothing comes for free. This implies some powerful nations offer financial assistance to gain access to local resources and tap into the labor market. Indeed, they seldom provide technological support to the local population and may even cause environmental damage in certain areas. Consequently, developing nations should not rely solely on financial assistance from powerful countries.\nIn conclusion, financial aid is not the exclusive means to support impoverished countries.

While these advantages are clear, I believe that the widespread use of mobile phones among young people is a detrimental trend.\nTo begin with, a significant number of young mobile phone users face challenges in school due to constant distractions from their devices. Games and apps on phones consume a lot of their time, reducing the time available for studying and engaging in school activities. Likewise, phones with internet access encourage young people to focus more on chatting and social media rather than academic work. During my college years, I was once hooked on a particular game on my mobile phone. I dedicated a significant amount of time trying to advance to higher levels to impress my friends. This ambition diverted my interest away from completing my homework, leading to a failure in one subject that semester.\nMoreover, youngsters who own mobile phones are inclined to become materialistic. They tend to buy phones not only for their features but also for the brand. Comparatively, these purchases often come at a high and unaffordable price. Additionally, a majority of these young people are students, hence they require financial backing from their parents to afford their desires. An example of this troubling trend is visible almost everywhere today, with many teenagers owning phones that cost double their parents' salary. \nThis evidently demonstrates that the adverse effects associated with mobile phones negatively impact a person's education and character.

Women today are far more dynamic; they can be successful entrepreneurs, participate in politics, become scientists, and much more. In other words, The so-called \"weaker\" gender has ample rights and capabilities to contribute to human progress just like men, and they often excel in certain areas.\nFurthermore, The evolution of women's rights has delivered numerous advantages not only to women themselves but also to society.

{"id": "id_646", "input": "The ongoing debate about whether universities should prioritize spending on enhancing facilities over hiring renowned educators is multifaceted. Some individuals advocate for investing in facility upgrades, while others argue that having distinguished teachers is more beneficial for students. After thoughtful consideration, I have formed my own viewpoint. I support the former, that is, I favor investing in upgrading facilities. \nThe most compelling reason is the undeniable truth that the more advanced our facilities, the greater our opportunities to expand knowledge. For instance, libraries provide an excellent environment for student study and research. Students can focus on their studies in a serene atmosphere and have access to numerous references. Such convenient and multifaceted facilities enhance students' learning experience. Consequently, we can begin to acknowledge that certain facilities offer significant benefits to students. \nFurthermore, another vital factor is that students do not spend all their time in classrooms. They engage in a variety of activities at school. Consider a student participating in a school jazz ensemble. A superior auditorium is essential for an outstanding performance. This remarkable performance will provide the student with a memorable and valuable experience. Hence, in light of this situation, we can assert that students would prefer schools to focus on enhancing facilities.\nAdmittedly, there are individuals who assert that schools should allocate funds to hire esteemed educators because such educators can effectively teach their students. However, from my limited perspective, I question the validity of this claim due to its recklessness. A student's success is determined by their effort, not solely by having a good teacher.

Less affluent nations require assistance from wealthier countries in these sectors to advance their development.\nTo begin with, in terms of healthcare, less wealthy nations typically have fewer doctors and nurses compared to more prosperous countries. High population levels in poorer nations, exacerbated by insufficient family planning, have led to an imbalance in the ratio of medical professionals to residents. Furthermore, there is a scarcity of hospitals in less developed nations to meet patient needs. To address these challenges, wealthier countries can assist by sending medical professionals to these nations and providing funds to establish healthcare facilities.\nSecondly, in the realm of education, it is widely acknowledged that poorer countries often face a shortage of school teachers and university lecturers. Additionally, education in these regions is usually not free, making it accessible only to a limited group of students. To tackle the shortage of educational staff, wealthier nations can send skilled educators to train more teachers and lecturers in less affluent countries. At the same time, to address the issue of educational expenses, wealthier nations should provide scholarships and loans to deserving students.\nFinally, in the trade sector, it is undeniable that poorer countries fall behind wealthier ones due to financial constraints. Trade activities in poorer nations may also be hindered by underdeveloped transportation infrastructure. For instance, people living in rural regions still rely on personal farming for their food supply. As a gesture of goodwill, richer countries can offer financial services to less affluent nations to stimulate trade. They can also provide guidance on developing a comprehensive and effective transportation network to bolster trade.\nIn conclusion, wealthier nations ought to assume greater responsibility in aiding less affluent countries across health, education, and trade.

This essay will delve into the reasons why I concur that individuals should occasionally engage in activities they don't find enjoyable is essential. \nFirstly, the majority of people's lives involve tasks they don't particularly relish. In our personal lives, we bear responsibilities to others, and there is no one who enjoys every single one of these obligations. For instance, I find housework quite challenging, even though my husband assists with some tasks, it remains my duty. I genuinely dislike all of them, yet I must fulfill them. \nSecondly, professional life is replete with crucial tasks inherent to the job. No one enjoys attending tedious conferences or working with someone who struggles with interpersonal skills. As a research assistant at a university, like others at ours, we have a professor who isn't adept at human interactions, making it unenjoyable for most assistants to converse with him, even though we must consult him regarding his expertise. \nThirdly, engaging in something one doesn't enjoy can ultimately lead to pleasure. People may sometimes participate in activities because a friend insists, even if they initially don't want to. For example, a friend mentioned a dance class to my husband and me, which neither of us were fond of. After some persuasion from friends, we joined the class and had a delightful experience, continuing for six months, even though most friends dropped out after a month. \nNo one's life is a constant stream of enjoyment; there are often unpleasant and dull aspects that no one enjoys, yet they are typically tied to responsibilities inherent in personal life.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay330", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 382, "to": 460}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 485, "to": 560}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 562, "to": 689}], "label": "Claim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 705, "to": 807}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 809, "to": 865}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 878, "to": 945}], "label": "Claim", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 947, "to": 1054}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1056, "to": 1296}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1308, "to": 1379}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1381, "to": 1490}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1505, "to": 1592}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1594, "to": 1760}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1812, "to": 1949}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 12}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 2, 5, 8, 12]}

This method of teaching has sparked a lively debate about whether it offers more advantages to students compared to traditional education. In my opinion, I support the notion that students gain greater advantages from remote learning.\nTo start with, studying from home can significantly reduce the time and costs for students. Students engaging in distance education can minimize travel time, tuition costs, and expenses for textbooks, thanks to an internet connection. This is particularly beneficial for children residing in remote rural areas and those from families struggling financially.\nFurthermore, long-distance learning grants students access to extensive knowledge databases and diverse teaching methods. Pupils can easily access materials required for their courses with a single click, including scientific papers, study articles, documentary archives, and more. A student can choose an online course tailored to his interests and schedule.so he can manage his learning pace and achieve satisfactory results in the chosen course.\nIt's undeniable that traditional education excels in providing face-to-face interactions, emotional motivation, and physical activities. These aspects play a crucial role in delivering instant feedback and nurturing students' character. However, with advancements in streaming and sensor technology, remote education can overcome barriers of distance and physical interaction.\nTo sum up, I acknowledge that traditional education offers unique benefits such as direct feedback and motivation that remain irreplaceable for the foreseeable future.

I wholeheartedly agree with this statement.\nIn recent years, the proportion of women has been increasing in many regions worldwide. Consequently, this issue encourages stakeholders from diverse areas to consider what steps they should take to stabilize economic growth and improve people's quality of life. It is evident now that women are now participating in various fields that were traditionally dominated by men, such as engineering and machinery.

Some argue that the optimal strategy to tackle this issue is by equipping the unemployed with smartphones that have Internet access. They also assert that this approach is the most suitable way to spend public funds. However, I can only partially support this idea as I believe that providing mobile phones to the unemployed is an absolute squandering of resources.\nFrom a positive standpoint, when jobless individuals possess smartphones with Internet capability, they can explore the web for additional employment opportunities. For instance, they can visit The Star Online's job section to seek positions that fit their qualifications. the Internet also allows them to gather more details about prospective jobs and discover ways to prepare for employment. Moreover, the smartphones can also facilitate communication with potential employers. In summary, if the government provides mobile phones to the unemployed, they will have better chances to secure jobs and sustain themselves.\nConversely, from a different angle, distributing smartphones to those without employment is a misuse of taxpayers' funds. This is because instead of being allocated to gadgets, the funds could be directed towards more beneficial national projects. To further explain, the money could be used to develop public facilities or assist the impoverished in earning a livelihood. To summarize, the funds could be employed for various purposes rather than distributing smartphones to the unemployed.\nAdditionally, providing free smartphones might prompt many to exploit this opportunity. it's foreseeable that some might quit jobs just to qualify for a free smartphone. there might be instances of individuals falsely claiming unemployment to obtain these phones. Within this framework, public funds are being squandered inefficiently. Furthermore, up to now, no studies or evidence have shown this approach to be effective in reducing unemployment rates.\nIn conclusion, the proposal of providing internet-enabled smartphones to the unemployed is neither the right nor the most effective method to reduce unemployment.

{"id": "id_652", "input": "The rapid growth in population leads to an increasing demand for transportation. Many nations have been grappling with issues such as pollution, noise, and traffic-related casualties for decades. From my point of view, the most effective solution to tackle these issues lies in enhancing roads and highways, supported by three key reasons.\nTo begin with, it is widely recognized that improving public transportation will exacerbate pollution and increase accidents. Vehicles like buses, cars, and trains frequently release harmful gases, leading to severe health conditions such as lung cancer and pneumonia. Additionally, the noise generated by vehicle engines can negatively impact our hearing abilities. Most significantly, road traffic is a major contributor to frequent accidents. For instance, in my country, buses are often blamed for the alarming rise in road accidents. Each year, in Vietnam, approximately twelve thousand people lose their lives annually in accidents, a figure comparable to the death toll of Japan's tsunami.\nNext, investing in road and highway infrastructure expands the capacity and accommodates more public transportation options. This allows not only buses but also private vehicles to move more smoothly on the roads. For example, I often leave school during peak hours when everyone is rushing home. Escaping the congestion during this time usually takes me at least an hour, which is highly inconvenient. Conversely, if roads are widened, people can reach home faster, and the likelihood of collisions drops significantly.\nFinally, allocating funds for road and highway renovation can greatly enhance their quality. Many people feel uneasy traveling on damaged roads filled with potholes. Such poor road conditions lead to numerous accidents and cause significant distress among commuters. Furthermore, It is unfair to place sole blame on drivers for traffic accidents due to part of the responsibility lies with the governing authorities. Moreover, smoother road surfaces enhance safety and facilitate easier transportation.\nIn summary, the benefits of upgrading roads mentioned earlier are both compelling and essential.

{"id": "id_653", "input": "A significant number of individuals believe that government funds should be allocated to enhancing roads and highways, while others argue that investing in public transportation would be more beneficial. Personally, governments should undoubtedly allocate funds towards the public transportation system, as it addresses the issues arising from the increasing number of private vehicles.\nInitially, utilizing public transportation cuts down the resources consumed in transportation. Automobiles rely on gasoline, a finite resource. Consequently, the greater the number of cars in use, the quicker we deplete the world's gasoline reserves. Conversely, efficient use of public transport reduces the gasoline consumption per individual significantly. Moreover, this is crucial in conserving our precious natural resource, gasoline.\nSecondly, public transportation contributes to addressing air pollution issues. On average, public transit systems consume considerably less gasoline to transport people than individual cars. This implies that by opting for public transit, there is a reduction in gas emissions into the atmosphere, alleviating the congested and polluted conditions on the roads.\nFinally, public transportation is considerably safer than using private vehicles. Data from the National Safety Council suggests that taking the bus is over 170 times safer than traveling by private car. Therefore, there is no rationale for governments to delay investment in public transport, which is a health-conscious, safe, and cost-effective mode of transport.\nIn conclusion, I am convinced that investing in the enhancement of public transportation is essential, since it serves as a pivotal measure to safeguard our planet, fostering a healthy and secure environment for inhabitants.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay198", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 216, "to": 302}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 307, "to": 385}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 398, "to": 480}], "label": "Claim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 482, "to": 529}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 545, "to": 636}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 650, "to": 745}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 757, "to": 826}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 838, "to": 906}], "label": "Claim", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 920, "to": 1018}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1020, "to": 1189}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1200, "to": 1271}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1273, "to": 1393}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1406, "to": 1556}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1593, "to": 1659}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1667, "to": 1781}], "label": "Claim", "id": 14}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 7, 12, 13, 14]}

While some agree that watching TV can be more effective for certain children, I find it hard to support the notion of students spending increased time in front of televisions. This is because traditional education remains the most suitable method. Therefore, promoting physical inactivity for the sake of enhancing children's skills is not advisable.\nFirstly, traditional teaching methods have been scientifically validated and used as the most effective way to educate children. Technology and its advancements have had a positive impact on the education sector to some extent. However, it hasn't diminished the vital role of teachers in classrooms. The fact that students today doing their homework or research on computers instead of visiting libraries exemplifies this. However, screens cannot substitute the presence of teachers because their expertise and flexibility are invaluable. Consequently, teachers cannot be replaced by inanimate screens.\nSecondly, spending time watching television is a passive activity that should not be encouraged. Conversely, children involved in activities fostering creativity, collaboration, and competition tend to excel in general. For example, a study demonstrates that children who engage in diverse outdoor activities outperform those who primarily watch documentaries in skills like identifying plant or animal species. Consequently, these activities can provide children with essential skills for their future careers.\nIn summary, although learning via television is suitable for certain children, children should not be encouraged to partake in such passive activities. schools have been employing traditional teaching methods for generations.

{"id": "id_655", "input": "There is an intense debate concerning whether in-person communication surpasses other forms of interaction, and this subject can be examined from multiple perspectives due to its intricacy. Some individuals believe that face-to-face communication is the most effective means of expression, while others hold an opposing view. After careful consideration, I have formed my own opinion. I support the former view; that is, I agree that face-to-face communication is better. \nThe primary reason is the undeniable reality that communicating in person can be more convincing. Sometimes, face-to-face communication can lead us to successfully persuade or lodge complaints, as exemplified by my uncle. He once complained about a restaurant's service. Without exaggeration, he directly approached the manager and pointed out that there was an issue with the meal\u2014a fly was hidden in it. Subsequently, my uncle received new service thanks to the direct communication. Had he merely written a complaint online or called, I doubt the issue would have been taken seriously. Consequently, we can begin to acknowledge that face-to-face communication is the most effective approach. \nBesides the point mentioned earlier, another equally critical aspect is that without face-to-face communication, it is easy to be misled. For example, I received some hurtful messages on Facebook from my close friend, Eric. He said that I had completely failed in maintaining a good friendship and no longer wanted to be friends with me. I was stunned and didn't understand what had happened. Eventually, I discovered that his Facebook account had been hacked. Therefore, from this instance, we can conclude that interacting face-to-face with people is vital. \nAdmittedly, there are those who argue that communication via letters, emails, or phone calls can allow for uninhibited conversation, which is also crucial in communication. Nevertheless, from my limited perspective, I question the reliability of that assertion. It is plausible that before speaking, we need to be cautious about our words. Speaking without restraint is not essential in communication; on the contrary, it often proves harmful. \nConsidering the reasons outlined above, I prefer to express my opinion in person because the benefits of this are significantly greater than those of the alternative. To put it differently, I believe the most effective method of communication is face-to-face. This is not to claim that other perspectives lack any merit whatsoever.

Some individuals believe that this trend mirrors and intensifies the high level of violence within society. I completely concur with this perspective for several specific reasons that will be discussed and analyzed in the following sections.\nTo begin with, it's important to recognize that police equipped with firearms or other legal weapons strive to protect not only civilians but also themselves. Consequently, today's criminals are highly sophisticated, investing significant sums to obtain advanced weapons to confront the police and fulfill their malicious purposes. Thus, citizens in such a society might be inadvertently shot by both law enforcement and offenders. Furthermore, during duty, not only citizens are affected but also structures like vehicles, homes, and streets are at risk of being damaged by firearms. Therefore, a society where the police force is armed will undoubtedly be perceived as extremely violent.\nAdditionally, the police carry guns only in societies with high crime rates. Hence, people and police in these areas typically contend with dangerous and varied crimes such as theft, robbery, murder, rape, vandalism, and arson. Clearly, These are potentially the strongest indicators of a society experiencing high levels of violence.\nIn summary, considering the aforementioned viewpoints, although arming the police force with guns is essential, it will lead to an elevated level of violence.

When tackling a challenging subject alone with limited resources, I often feel disheartened after investing significant time. In such instances, I seek out a teacher and ask for their assistance.

Self-teaching in these areas is almost impractical and ineffective. Incidentally, Self-learning can result in misunderstandings and incorrect grasp of concepts!

To a certain degree, I disagree with this notion because I hold the view that it is the criminal mentality that fosters violence, not strict gun regulation. \nFirst and foremost, it appears valid that implementing gun control should theoretically lead to a decline in crime since a reduction in accessible firearms equates to decreased criminal activity. Nonetheless, the issue is more complex than it appears. \nIn reality, strict gun regulation does not effectively reduce violence and criminal acts due to the fact that the majority of gun-related crimes are perpetrated with firearms acquired unlawfully. Individuals determined to engage in criminal activities and exert control over urban areas through gang violence and other methods will continue to access firearms, notwithstanding gun regulations. \nFurthermore, non-compliant individuals will exist globally, whether among law enforcement or ordinary citizens. Consequently, the fundamental cause of violence is the criminal mindset, not the weapon itself. Thus, to effectively manage crime within a community, a government must focus on regulating the actions of its populace rather than solely the firearms used in violent acts. \nUltimately, it is clear that there is a weak correlation between police carrying firearms and an increase in violence rates.

Some argue that these diverse advertisements persuade people to purchase unnecessary items that merely appear appealing on television. I am inclined to agree with this perspective.\nTo increase their revenue and attract customers, companies invest heavily in advertising. Often, it is not really about the products' function or quality, but rather about promoting the pleasurable feeling of owning them. In other words, large corporations enlist celebrities to endorse their products. By featuring famous singers in their TV commercials, for items like motorcycles or clothing, sales see a significant boost because young people, whom the ads target, idolize celebrities. Given that owning these products signifies their social status, the quality is clearly not of primary concern.\nNonetheless, even though advertisements can be misleading and overblown, it is undeniable that it plays a crucial economic role. They unveil new products, offer various options, and are often visually appealing, as their purpose is to capture your attention. Advertising also contributes to keeping prices affordable and fosters a competitive commercial environment. Otherwise, the market could become monopolized, with limited choices and inflated prices.\nEven though the influence of advertising might be exaggerated, we cannot overlook that the ultimate choice rests with us as consumers.

{"id": "id_663", "input": "In recent years, the internet has gained immense popularity, offering individuals an extensive reservoir of information. Consequently, traditional print media like newspapers have seen a significant drop in readership. Some people still hold the belief that these can endure over time; others contend that newspapers have lost their competitive edge needed for long-term survival. Personally, I lean towards agreeing with the latter perspective for the following reasons.\nTo begin with, accessing information via the internet is faster and more convenient than reading newspapers. Unlike the past when waiting hours for the daily paper was necessary, today, people can get up-to-the-minute news updates every second through their internet-connected mobile devices, anytime and anywhere. Clearly, such devices are widespread globally, allowing individuals to access a range of content that newspapers simply cannot cover within their limited pages. Therefore, print media has lost its crucial role in delivering information.\nAdditionally, from an economic standpoint, purchasing newspapers seems unnecessary when the internet is accessible to everyone. It is evident that internet services are offered at a minimal cost or even for free in numerous countries. The question then arises: would anyone choose to spend extra money on newspapers to get the same or even less information than what is readily available online? The likely response is that few rational individuals would choose to do so. For this reason, the readership of newspapers may continue to decline sharply, potentially causing many to shut down in the near future.\nFinally, considering the environmental impact, it's clear that more newspaper production results in more deforestation. This directly contributes to the global deforestation problem. At this juncture, the newspaper industry will likely face opposition from environmentalists in its efforts to remain viable.\nIn conclusion, while it may be disheartening for newspaper advocates to witness the potential demise of this media form, it should be viewed as a consequence of the relentless advancements in media technology and our modern lifestyle.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay007", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 306, "to": 379}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 487, "to": 579}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 581, "to": 785}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 787, "to": 946}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 959, "to": 1022}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1038, "to": 1150}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1171, "to": 1257}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1420, "to": 1494}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1513, "to": 1631}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1642, "to": 1751}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1753, "to": 1814}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1834, "to": 1939}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}], "edges": [{"source": 4, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 4, 8, 11]}

Although the mother's influence is crucial in a child's upbringing, I wholeheartedly affirm that fatherhood plays an equally critical role in a healthy parenting process as motherhood does.\nThe primary rationale for advocating the father's role to be on par with the mother's is rooted in the intrinsic nature of parenting. From my perspective, family role models are pivotal in shaping the traits and characteristics of the child. For instance, in a typical Turkish household, while the mother adopts a nurturing and considerate stance, the father's presence as an authoritative and conservative figure is essential for molding a well-mannered child. \nThe second argument supporting the equal importance of fatherhood and motherhood is the dynamics of contemporary relationships. Personally, we exist in a society that highly values gender equality across all facets of life, including relational dynamics. For example, the traditional family structure with a woman as a homemaker and caregiver and a man as the breadwinner is becoming obsolete in today's world. Rather, all responsibilities within the couple are shared equally and can be exchanged between partners.

Many of us strive to keep pace with the rapid changes happening around us. Personally, I am of the opinion that while keeping pace with the fast-moving world might seem like a smart strategy. Nonetheless, it may not be the most advantageous choice for our community.\nFirst and foremost, even in a world that moves swiftly, precision remains essential. Even straightforward tasks, such as homework, demand precision. If we hurry through our tasks, risking errors, we end up making no real effort, merely rushing to meet deadlines. Ultimately, it simply completes the task, which is ultimately futile. We should focus on enhancing our ability to work rather than just aiming to finish. Undoubtedly, it might take longer to match others if we need to review our work repeatedly, but with regular effort, we'll eventually increase our speed in completing tasks.\nFurthermore, besides the necessity of precision, the world demands efficiency, which includes quick completion and quality standards. Even if we keep pace by overlooking project details and focusing only on the bigger picture, this won't satisfy the company or clients. We will soon become irrelevant even if we maintain the pace because when issues arise, we'll need to revisit and correct our mistakes. This could be more costly and time-consuming than getting it right the first time.\nAdditionally, when considering this issue on a larger scale, Some tasks simply cannot afford any errors, for example, in high-stakes missions like those conducted by NASA, even a minor error can have disastrous consequences. A slight miscalculation in a rocket launch's orbit can result in a project failure worth trillions. In these situations, scientists may wish to conclude their tasks swiftly, but they can't afford to overlook any aspect of the mission, as it could lead to numerous issues.\nIn conclusion, even though it is crucial to keep up with the world's pace, we must exercise extreme caution because careless work is unacceptable if we wish to remain competitive.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay314", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 228, "to": 300}], "label": "Claim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 315, "to": 375}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 397, "to": 460}], "label": "Claim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 462, "to": 524}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 526, "to": 638}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 652, "to": 708}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 710, "to": 792}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 807, "to": 884}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 890, "to": 966}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 981, "to": 1100}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1102, "to": 1236}], "label": "Claim", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1238, "to": 1297}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1306, "to": 1371}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1373, "to": 1454}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1517, "to": 1559}], "label": "Claim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1574, "to": 1679}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1681, "to": 1779}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1802, "to": 1951}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1980, "to": 2026}], "label": "Claim", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2028, "to": 2060}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2069, "to": 2131}], "label": "Claim", "id": 20}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 7, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 10, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 10, 14, 18, 19, 20]}
{"id": "id_667", "input": "In today's world, automobiles have become one of the most crucial modes of transportation in daily life. A vast number of individuals own cars and use them regularly, highlighting their significance. Overall, I wholeheartedly concur with the notion that cars have enhanced the quality of modern life, for various reasons.\nTo begin with, individuals can now cover long distances swiftly, which brings numerous benefits. Take relationships as an example. Many people can now sustain relationships across large distances because they have the ability to visit each other regularly using their cars. Reflecting on my personal experiences, I remember that my car has always facilitated frequent visits to my childhood friends despite living in a different city. I was also able to form a relationship with someone who lived 89 kilometers away. Thanks to my car, we could meet on weekends and are still happily together today. Without my car, it would likely have been impossible to build a relationship.\nMoreover, cars boost employment opportunities because people can commute to work and take jobs farther from their homes. Additionally, they experience greater flexibility. For instance, my father has worked all over Germany and consequently earned more money. He used his car to travel to distant parts of the country, worked there during the week, and returned home for weekends. Without a car, he wouldn't have been able to visit his family on weekends, so his vehicle is a significant asset both financially and socially.\nLastly, the automobile enables frequent travel, allowing people to explore the world. Without cars, people tend to remain in their hometowns or villages for most of their lives. They primarily rely on public transport, which limits their ability to reach certain areas.

Some students continue to depend on lectures to stay abreast of their coursework, while others feel no compulsion to attend classes, confident in their ability to excel in exams independently. These varied approaches to learning prompt the question: is it truly essential for university students to attend lectures if they can successfully pass their exams? From my perspective, I assert that students should consistently attend lectures regardless of their exam results. \nFirstly, engaging in lectures proves more beneficial for comprehension than merely preparing alone for exams. Classes are meticulously crafted for learners, and instructors undeniably possess greater expertise than students. Professors not only have expertise but also hold experience that helps them guide students towards academic success. \nSecondly, it's a fundamental duty of students to attend lectures. Attending lectures is a compelling way for students to demonstrate respect to both their instructors and themselves. Numerous instructors factor attendance into students' grades. Put differently, attendance is considered as important as exam performance. Even those who excel in exams might fail if they neglect attending classes.\nThere are those who may contend that students might already have a grasp of the class content sufficient to pass exams or can independently study the course. Why spend time in lectures when self-study might be more productive? Nonetheless, I maintain that this reflects a somewhat presumptuous mindset. I trust that professors can provide students with insights beyond what students might achieve on their own due to their experience and credentials. Moreover, even if students feel exceedingly competent, attending classes allows them to engage in dialogue with professors and peers. \nIn summary, students gain deeper understanding and show respect for both their instructors and themselves by attending lectures.

Companies, driven by the need to survive in a competitive environment, continuously enhance their products and services, which in turn leads to societal prosperity. Yet, when we delve into the debate of competition versus cooperation, our focus shifts from the broader society to the development of an individual's entire life. From this perspective, I am convinced that greater emphasis should be placed on cooperation during early education.\nTo begin with, through collaboration, children can acquire interpersonal skills that are crucial throughout their future lives. What we gain from teamwork extends beyond achieving a common goal with others; more importantly, it involves learning how to interact well with others. In the course of working together, children can develop skills such as listening to others' opinions, communicating effectively, thinking holistically, and even compromising with team members during disagreements. These abilities enable them to form positive relationships and will be advantageous throughout their lives.\nConversely, the essence of competition lies in learning how to excel in order to achieve victory. Thus, it is frequently claimed that competition enhances societal efficiency. Nonetheless, when pondering the question of how to win, we often discover that cooperation is essential. The grander our objectives, the more competition becomes necessary. Consider the Olympics, a competitive arena; it's difficult to envision an athlete winning without the guidance of a coach and support from professionals handling nutrition and medical care. The athlete may be the victor, but the triumph is shared by the entire team.

The classroom setting provides opportunities to learn from peers, because observing a classmate excelling can motivate you to enhance your own performance. For instance, During my first year pursuing a B Com, my lack of seriousness towards studies changed when I noticed friends achieving higher grades, inspiring me to improve my efforts.

Furthermore, engaging in group studies teaches effective communication with others. This strengthens communication and teamwork skills, which are beneficial for future career prospects.\nThirdly, In classroom learning, professors, being experts in their fields, provide valuable insights and skills. Working closely with professors allows for direct interaction and doubt clarification. Consequently, this facilitates faster learning.

Consequently, At the start of their education, students can grasp and assimilate a foreign language more swiftly and effortlessly than older individuals. They can easily grasp the language's structural nuances and memorize vocabulary. It is indisputable that The retention of knowledge gained in childhood surpasses that acquired at later stages of life.

{"id": "id_672", "input": "When discussing students, we typically refer to boys or girls enrolled in school or college. In certain countries, teenage students are afforded the chance to engage in part-time work alongside their studies. Nonetheless, there are individuals who oppose the idea of teenagers taking up jobs while pursuing their education. Personally, taking on a part-time job while still studying is advantageous for teenagers, and I have two main reasons to support this view.\nThe first reason is that such jobs provide students with valuable learning experiences before they enter the professional world. Students gain insights into managing their time, handling finances, and persuading others effectively. For instance, I spent a year working as a salesperson in a shop during my high school days. Since I had to allocate some of my time to this job, which meant I was compelled to organize my schedule efficiently. I managed both my employer\u2019s expectations and my homework simultaneously. This experience taught me the importance of efficient time management and completing tasks swiftly. Additionally, I also developed skills in financial management. Whenever my boss was absent, I was responsible for overseeing the shop\u2019s accounts. Through this, I learned how to handle money responsibly. This experience highlighted how part-time jobs can impart diverse and valuable lessons to students.\nAnother reason is that part-time jobs allow students to earn money, which can ease their parents' financial burden. For example, during my high school years, I worked as a home tutor teaching mathematics to my neighbor's two children. I guided them through challenging topics in their textbooks. By tutoring them, I was able to earn money and purchase books for myself. Furthermore, After taking up the tutoring job, I stopped asking my parents for pocket money. Clearly, This demonstrates how part-time jobs enable students to earn and help alleviate their parents' financial strain.\nTo conclude, I acknowledge that some people may disagree with the idea of students holding part-time jobs. They may argue that working part-time may distract students from their studies. However, as my own experience with a part-time job during high school did not negatively affect my academic performance, I firmly believe part-time jobs are beneficial for students.

In my view, animals should inhabit their natural environments rather than zoos.\nFirstly, wild species have the inherent right to exist in settings free from human interference. Considering that humans are the main culprits behind the extensive pollution and significant harm to the natural habitats of numerous wild creatures, it is our duty to establish a natural and secure environment for animals to reside in. Clearly, the confined spaces and artificial environments do not adequately replace the natural losses animals experience. Additionally, prolonged captivity in zoos can adversely affect both the physical and mental well-being of rural animals. Consequently, wild species may endure feelings of loneliness and depression. It appears that zoos are more likely to act as threats rather than protectors of wildlife.\nOn the other hand, proponents might claim that zoos equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and trained experts can offer superior care to the animals housed there.

A contentious topic currently is whether the government should bear the responsibility for providing healthcare and education to its citizens.\nSome individuals contend that the government ought to be responsible for financing healthcare and education for its citizens. The reason is individuals have a right to live in a peaceful and secure environment, which should be ensured by the government, as the societal leader. Without access to healthcare and education, citizens' physical and mental well-being could be compromised. Consequently, these individuals might not receive timely treatment, thereby affecting their work productivity and destabilizing industry output. Moreover, lacking proper teacher guidance, these citizens could engage in misconduct or even criminal activities, threatening the safety of others. Thus, to maintain societal safety and stability, the government should be responsible for citizens' healthcare and education.\nConversely, others disagree, stating that allocating public funds for everyone's healthcare and education is an unnecessary expenditure, because many individuals actually possess the means to privately afford both healthcare and education. Instead, the government should prioritize tackling urgent issues affecting society's well-being, such as the rising crime rates, AIDS epidemic, or infrastructure shortages, all of which demand financial intervention.\nIn my opinion, I believe the government should provide financial assistance for healthcare and education to those who are truly in need.

{"id": "id_678", "input": "It is widely recognized that under British and Australian laws, juries involved in a case lack information about a criminal's previous unlawful activities. Some individuals express concerns and believe the existing practice should be revised so that juries should have some knowledge of the criminals before reaching a verdict. Personally, I fully endorse this proposal as it offers benefits to various parties, which I will elaborate on below.\nFirstly, I contend that having information about the criminal's past would simplify the jury's decision-making process. This is because a thorough understanding of their background allows juries to assess the crime before formulating a judgment. For example, consider an individual who has never committed murder but is suddenly found guilty. By being informed about the person, juries can ascertain whether the crime was committed deliberately or due to external factors. Subsequently, the punishment can be tailored to the specific circumstances.\nMoreover, a just trial can be ensured. As is common knowledge, juries are composed of individuals with little to no legal expertise. Consequently, providing them with the criminal's past records allows for more rational deliberation, which ultimately leads to a more meaningful decision. By doing this, juries will experience relief in knowing they reached a superior conclusion based on ample evidence. Additionally, the accused will also receive equitable treatment.\nIt is indisputable that delving into and disclosing the convicted individual's history to a crowd of unknown people compromises their privacy. If they are ultimately proven innocent, they may feel humiliated when confronting the public. Nonetheless, I am convinced that criminal activities should be exposed, and the public should be informed to prevent them from falling victim.\nIn summary, I firmly believe that the existing method of jury decision-making should be reformed, and they should be informed about the criminals they're evaluating.

Some argue that a broad knowledge base enhances the likelihood of success, while others believe that expertise in a particular area is essential for achieving success. Both perspectives offer compelling arguments. In my view, having a broad spectrum of knowledge is the cornerstone of success. Here are my reasons.\nTo begin with, being familiar with diverse areas of work can facilitate forming friendships more easily. For instance, during my tenure at a large company with various departments, I was part of the Management Information System division. Our daily task involved addressing clients' inquiries by phone. Although some issues were related to the Engineering department, I went there to engage in discussions with my colleagues, because I had taken several engineering courses. It became simpler for me to connect with others than anyone else in my department, enhancing my popularity and making it easier to receive assistance when needed.\nMoreover, having awareness of various fields is crucial when you decide to shift your major. Consider my cousin Jeff and his friend as an illustration. While they pursued finance in college, they opted to enter the art world post-graduation. Due to Jeff's dedication during his free time, he gained extensive knowledge about art history. Ultimately, Jeff became part of a remarkable team, whereas his friend, limited to finance knowledge, ended up working at a bank.\nAlthough I agree that familiarity with different fields holds significance, I must acknowledge differing viewpoints. Critics might contend that if someone cannot succeed in their own specialty, what else can they achieve in different fields. This argument holds some truth. However, what if someone discovers their true talent lies in another area. Thus, it poses no real problem.\nIn conclusion, when weighing the pros and cons of acquiring knowledge across various fields, the optimal choice clearly aligns with my stance, which is that having a comprehensive understanding of multiple disciplines is truly vital.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay263", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 372, "to": 438}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 476, "to": 564}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 764, "to": 885}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 895, "to": 934}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 936, "to": 1097}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1109, "to": 1190}], "label": "Claim", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1341, "to": 1435}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1437, "to": 1564}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1710, "to": 1806}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1849, "to": 1913}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2104, "to": 2179}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 10}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 1, 5, 8, 10]}

They maintain that from an early age in kindergarten, teachers instruct students in essential skills such as writing, reading, and arithmetic. In elementary school, educators impart more advanced knowledge, including writing techniques and computer usage. Teachers play a crucial role in guiding students through academic challenges. Conversely, students acquire most of their understanding through teacher guidance, learning to discern right from wrong with their support.\nThose who assert that students acquire a wealth of knowledge from alternative sources like the Internet and television, strongly hold the view that through these platforms, students access information that is not covered in classrooms.

Furthermore, advocates argue that quality television programs provide educational value. For example, The Discovery Channel offers numerous educational episodes.

Some might suggest that games aid adults in unwinding and achieving balance in life.

For instance, in my country, apart from a small group of professional athletes, most people cease playing games seriously once they secure a respectable job. They often perceive these games as more of a hassle than a source of enjoyment in their daily existence.\nAdditionally, it is worth noting that adults typically do not engage in games competitively, whereas children are always eager to compete and win. For the young, nurturing their competitive spirit often cultivates numerous admirable traits, irrespective of their participation in sports. For example, my younger sister is fond of fencing, and her competitive drive ensures she never surrenders in tough scenarios, even when injured. Conversely, adults often regard such actions as immature and abandon them without hesitation. Indeed, a person with a competitive nature often struggles to collaborate effectively with peers and coworkers. Consequently, they cease participating in games for modest successes, gradually losing interest in these pursuits.\nIn conclusion, I believe adults do indeed play games, but their approach differs from children's, tending to be less competitive and more focused on enjoyment.

{"id": "id_691", "input": "As people have grown more aware of their democratic rights in recent years, they are increasingly concerned about how the government allocates tax expenditures. Consequently, there are suggestions that tax funds should be directed towards services that benefit the public rather than the arts. However, from my standpoint, I believe arts should be considered a part of the government's investment as well.\nAdmittedly, the government ought to prioritize public services and infrastructure. This is because the government acts as a leader among citizens and should take on the responsibility of using tax money efficiently to ensure societal safety and stability. At the same time, public services like the education system and healthcare can meet people's fundamental needs for survival, security, and knowledge, thereby making them feel at ease, which can reduce crime rates. Therefore, public services and infrastructure need to be adequately prioritized by the authorities to uphold social stability.\nConversely, I am convinced that arts must not be overlooked by the government. On a personal level, arts have the potential to enrich individuals' cultural experiences. Currently, due to intense competition, people are becoming more engrossed in their work and studies. As a result, they need various forms of entertainment such as music, films, or literature to help them relax and relieve stress. Without arts, individuals might face an increased risk of psychological issues.\nLooking at it from the local community's perspective, investing in the arts supports local cultural and economic growth. Cultural heritage is a significant component of the arts. This implies protecting local arts may foster the conservation of the local cultural heritage, which not only provides locals with a sense of belonging but also boosts the local tourism sector. From this standpoint, arts fulfill both cultural and economic roles.\nConsidering these arguments, I would conclude that public services and infrastructure are essential elements of government spending.

{"id": "id_692", "input": "Nowadays, a growing number of university professors are dedicating themselves to scientific inquiries. Some worry this shift might lower educational standards and advocate for professors to focus more on teaching. However, based on my personal observations, professors should be encouraged to primarily focus on research.\nTo begin with, engaging in research serves as a self-enhancement tool for professors. Universities offer a somewhat isolated environment. Research projects enable interaction with the broader community. Moreover, through research, professors can stay abreast of the latest advancements in technology. I vividly recall my professor participating in numerous research ventures during my college years. He was frequently invited to deliver talks at other universities. Even though despite my university not being highly ranked, he earned recognition through these projects. Research initiatives act as gateways to a broader world.\nFurthermore, professors should fully capitalize on the research-conducive environment that universities provide. Cutting-edge laboratories are a common sight on university campuses. Additionally, There is no other place where you can find such a concentration of talented individuals. Thus, there's truly no justification for discouraging professors from leveraging these advantages. It's widely known that Einstein formulated the theory of general relativity while he was a professor at HU Berlin. Universities play a significant role in the achievements of professors. \nFinally, conducting research can also enhance the quality of teaching. Research projects enable professors to guide their students into the real-world context from the confines of the classroom. They can effectively instruct students on applying theoretical knowledge in practical settings. I distinctly remember the time when I was an assistant in one of my professor's research projects. Participating in it gave me the chance to apply textbook theories in real-world experiments. Research projects offer a more efficient approach to teaching. \nConsidering all these factors, it makes perfect sense to advocate for professors dedicating more time to research.

Nonetheless, some argue that fostering competitiveness in children is preferable to promoting cooperation, with each perspective having its own merits.\nEncouraging a strong sense of competition urges children to strive for excellence among their peers. This drive often originates from schools and parents who push for high scores through grading systems.. Although a child with a competitive nature is typically more driven to achieve goals and tackle challenges on their own, there's a risk of children becoming excessively competitive, hindering their ability to collaborate with others. While competitiveness can lead to success, it may also impose limitations. To illustrate, a highly competitive individual might struggle with teamwork projects.\nConversely, cooperation is a vital trait for children, whether in school settings or community interactions. Cultivating a spirit of cooperation enables kids to communicate effectively and build relationships, increasing their ability to solve problems or reach goals as a team. Ultimately, in society, significant achievements are rarely accomplished single-handedly. For instance, celebrities, such as renowned singers or movie stars, despite their talents, rely on teams to handle various tasks.\nFrom my perspective, while competitive children possess greater motivation and vision that can guide them toward success, this alone might not be beneficial in environments, like society or workplaces, where teamwork skills are essential.

{"id": "id_694", "input": "Upon finding the opportunity to study collaboratively with my classmates, I wished I could turn back time and retake all my tests. Personally, I favor group study because of several distinct advantages, such as receiving assistance from peers, enhancing my learning approach, and efficiently managing my time.\nWhen students form a study group, each member has an equal opportunity to support one another. They can collaborate to grasp the complex elements of a subject. For instance, when a group encounters a challenging math problem, they can exchange ideas to find a solution. Moreover, such a significant impact of collaboration is that all students can address their weaknesses within a group setting. \nBoosting motivation and fostering a spirit of competition are additional advantages of studying in groups. In a group of students, the top performers always inspire others to put in more effort. Additionally, students often engage in healthy competition to achieve the highest grades within the group. Clearly, enhanced learning is one of the noticeable outcomes of these competitive and encouraging dynamics. \nWhen students study with peers, they must create a schedule to utilize their time efficiently. Studying in groups instills a sense of responsibility to manage time effectively, as we are mindful of others and aim not to squander their time. Consequently, time management is another remarkable advantage of group study. \nTo sum up, I am a strong advocate for studying with friends because of the significant benefits this approach offers.

Personally, I think adopting a universal language worldwide is a beneficial transformation, aiding in the creation of a more harmonious global community.\nA world with fewer languages enhances our ability to communicate effectively with one another. Globalization has resulted in increased international travel for work. Therefore, using a single language simplifies travelers' daily interactions, such as ordering food or navigating unfamiliar locations. Moreover, students relocating for superior educational opportunities would experience less stress since they can effortlessly forge new friendships and participate in discussions, which is challenging in a multilingual world; this ease facilitates smoother adaptation to new environments. A single language also diminishes misunderstandings among individuals. Additionally, the sharing of knowledge in various research fields like electronics, medicine, and astronomy becomes more accessible.\nConversely, some are concerned about the fading of native languages. These languages are fundamental to the development and early communication of diverse cultures. They are emblematic of local heritage. As the use of these languages diminishes, cultural transformations occur in tandem. Furthermore, these languages are intricately linked to history; ancient literature and manuscripts will become indecipherable if these languages vanish.\nIn conclusion, I contend change is unavoidable, and the global adoption of a single language is a favorable development.

I am convinced that reducing the number of patients in the healthcare system can lead to more efficient management of hospitals and healthcare centers, resulting in improved treatments for existing patients. Consequently, the community needs to be educated and made aware of health issues so that potential precautions against illnesses can be implemented rather than focusing solely on treating an increasing number of patients.\nAnother reason why governments should allocate more funds toward illness prevention and health education is the overall welfare of society. From my perspective, nothing is more crucial than health in a person's life, and well-being and happiness are closely linked to being healthy. Thus, a government's responsibility should be to provide resources that enable citizens to learn how to prevent potential illnesses that could bring suffering to their lives.

To clarify this perspective, I can recount a personal incident. At the age of 14, I lost my uncle, and it seemed like nothing mattered anymore. Engaging with my friends proved to be discouraging because none of them had experienced such feelings. Given that I spent considerable time alone at home, my dog stayed close to me, and it felt like he was the only one who could comprehend my deep emotions. It is evident that although pets cannot verbally communicate with us, we can still rely on them.\nFurthermore, pets serve many useful purposes. For instance, pet therapy is gaining more popularity nowadays. Researchers have found that pets offer advantages in countless medical conditions.

{"id": "id_704", "input": "The rapid acceleration of life brought about by modern technologies and globalization has been remarkable in recent decades. Yet, while most people embrace this fast-paced lifestyle, some choose to slow down and savor their moments. To fully understand the situation, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons of this accelerated pace and determine which lifestyle is preferable. In my view, embracing a slower pace in life is crucial, because rushing through life has numerous drawbacks.\nTo begin with, a fast-paced lifestyle is stressful and can negatively impact health. Constantly being in a rush without taking breaks can cause adverse reactions in your body. Numerous industrious individuals suffer from conditions like burnout syndrome, because their bodies are unable to sustain such a hurried pace. For instance, my father experienced a breakdown several years ago due to his high-pressure job. After taking several weeks off, he recovered and now enjoys a slower lifestyle.\nMoreover, slowing down in life enhances happiness. Excessive stress prevents you from being attentive to your loved ones. Taking time for your family and friends is easier when you're not rushing. Nurturing social connections boosts happiness and lowers stress levels. For example, a friend of mine leads a leisurely life and finds great fulfillment in it, because he relishes spending time with family and maintaining friendships.\nAdditionally, achieving quality requires time.

These needs stimulate associated businesses in the vicinity, thereby creating numerous employment opportunities for locals and enhancing infrastructure and living standards. Consequently, tourism has evidently enhanced the quality of life in the host nation.\nAdditionally, the tourism sector has played a role in safeguarding cultural traditions and protecting natural landscapes. For example, In Vietnam, cultural expressions such as the 'Trong Dong' drum performance and natural wonders like 'Ha Long' Bay are being promoted and financially supported by the tourism ministry. Without the backing and revenue generated from tourism, many traditional cultural practices might vanish due to their low economic returns.

Nonetheless, it's evident that ready-made meals can have adverse effects due to the use of artificial additives, the disregard for nutritional value, and changes in eating patterns. In this essay, I aim to explain why this isn't beneficial based on the three aforementioned reasons.\nTo start with, to simplify cooking and enhance flavor, nearly every manufacturer incorporates a variety of artificial ingredients into the food now commonly purchased by consumers. Some these added components have led to serious repercussions. For example, frequently, newspapers and magazines publish articles that link specific chemicals in certain foods to various illnesses. Therefore, convenient-to-cook meals can occasionally pose health risks.\nAvoiding the cooking of fresh ingredients will also result in a nutritional deficit. While it's true that cooking pre-packaged meals takes significantly less time compared to fresh food, Nonetheless, studies have clearly shown that pre-packaged meals fail to supply the necessary nutrients we require, especially for growing children.\nAdditionally, cooking is among the artistic creations of humanity. The more we consume ready-made meals, the more we lose our culinary expertise. With the accelerating pace of life, most people prefer to use a microwave as their sole cooking appliance, enabling them to prepare a meal in mere minutes. However, few individuals realize that this has led to a shift in cooking practices, potentially resulting in the erosion of our culinary traditions and cultural identity.\nIn summary, even though the development of ready-to-eat meals undoubtedly meets the needs of those engrossed in their careers, this is not advantageous.

{"id": "id_707", "input": "Regarding the dilemma of whether classmates or colleagues should collaborate face-to-face or via email, I firmly believe that face-to-face collaboration is preferable as it facilitates effective communication. \nTo begin with, team members may possess differing perspectives and need to efficiently reach a unified stance. Clearly, engaging in face-to-face discussions during meetings surpasses email exchanges. An experiment by Beijing University involved two groups discussing an event budget. The first group engaged in face-to-face discussion, whereas the second group did so via email. It was found that the first group took 30 minutes to agree on the budget, whereas the second took 30 hours. Similar experiments conducted by other scientists yielded the same conclusion that direct conversation enables quicker consensus. \nMoreover, working in person can indirectly enhance the project's quality and efficiency due to there will be fewer conflicts or disputes among team members. Emails tend to make informal matters appear formal, thus recipients might feel anxious or possibly offended by the written tone. Although if the same words are spoken, the listener tends to be more at ease because their reactions are not recorded, preventing confusion of informal talk as an official statement. Consequently, fewer misunderstandings lead to reduced conflicts and foster better communication among team members. \nCertainly, there are instances where emails are necessary when team members are geographically dispersed. Even though emails may not be ideal for collaboration but are better than having no communication. Given that for classroom or campus projects, it is unlikely that participants are spread across different locations. \nOn the other hand, it's important to acknowledge that projects require extensive coordination, and conveying each opinion via email could result in an overwhelming number of messages, which is not desirable.

While some individuals argue that instilling a cooperative mindset in children is vital, others believe that competition is the key to success.

Educational institutions focus on promoting cooperative behavior among young learners. In a social environment, mutual assistance and sharing pave the way for success. No individual can learn or accomplish everything independently. For example, lions hunt collaboratively. Their ability to capture prey is facilitated by their teamwork, simplifying the task. Similarly, A cooperative approach conserves time and energy, increasing success probabilities.\nOn the other hand, Cooperation aids in comprehending others' viewpoints and learning from their errors. It enables one to discern personal strengths and weaknesses in relation to others. Observing others' accomplishments in a cooperative setting can inspire and motivate.

Competition drives progress and advancement. For instance, Companies are constantly developing new cars that outperform existing models. Such competition broadens consumer choices.\nNevertheless, Selfish and blind competition can be harmful. A 'your loss, my gain' mindset in competition is never sustainable over time.

A free mind is the source of creativity. Therefore, artists should be granted the liberty to express their thoughts without any limitations.\nThroughout history, creative figures such as Michaelangelo, Picasso, Salman Rushdie, and Shakespeare have crafted works that conveyed social messages. From sculptures to paintings, literature to theater and films, these creative endeavors have highlighted the social challenges of various time periods. Artistic creations contribute to social consciousness by delivering societal messages.\nYet, Innovative creations encourage individuals to reflect peacefully and examine their own morals. It serves to spotlight issues and critique governmental missteps. For example, Bangladeshi author Taslima Nasrin faced accusations of opposing the government merely for addressing a societal concern. Such attitudes impede the cultivation of creative minds. Furthermore, creativity also provides aesthetic appeal.\nRegrettably, a lot of governments place constraints on artists. Frank Zappa famously remarked, \"A mind is like a parachute; it only functions when open\". Imposing restrictions would stifle the inventive thoughts of artists and restrict their mental capabilities. Similar to the media, artists should be permitted to express their ideas openly.\nNevertheless, artists need to be mindful not to offend public sensitivities. Numerous artists have sparked controversies by offending the religious or social convictions of the masses. Artists ought to be conscious of not producing offensive, vulgar, or pointless works that lack meaningful purpose.

From my perspective, no aspect of life is more vital than health, and happiness and well-being are intertwined with good health. Consequently, the duty of a government is to offer resources that enable its citizens to learn how to prevent potential illnesses that could bring distress to their lives. As an illustration, the Ministry of Health's marketing campaign in Turkey, which targeted youth smoking issues, enhanced the well-being of those who quit smoking and embraced a healthier lifestyle following the initiative.\nTo sum up, a larger portion of the budget should be dedicated to education and preventive measures rather than treatment to achieve a more effective health system and a higher level of well-being.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay400", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 184, "to": 296}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 298, "to": 429}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 451, "to": 625}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 634, "to": 707}], "label": "Claim", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 716, "to": 845}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 872, "to": 989}], "label": "Claim", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1012, "to": 1118}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1134, "to": 1290}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1312, "to": 1513}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1526, "to": 1710}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 9}], "edges": [{"source": 3, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 3, 5, 9]}

While some critics argue that this practice is harsh on animals and the environment, I am convinced that it would be tremendously irresponsible to humanity if new foods or medicines were marketed without undergoing animal testing. In this essay, I will explore the issue from two perspectives.\nFirstly, it is widely acknowledged that animals are cherished companions and essential to human existence, because the absence of animals would disrupt the ecological equilibrium and ultimately lead to human extinction. Animal testing accelerates the extinction of certain animal species. Put differently, conducting various experiments poses a threat to the future of humanity and forthcoming generations.\nAlthough animal testing adversely affects the natural equilibrium, it is crucial to ensure that humans can enjoy a long lifespan. To start with, it is undeniable that any new food or medication may be harmful, and scientists must take measures to ensure these innovations benefit rather than harm or even kill people. The purpose of new food and medicine inventions is to enhance human longevity. Therefore, even those willing to volunteer cannot substitute animals in testing new foods or medicines.

Due to advanced technology, wealthy countries have made significant strides in developing medicines that can treat numerous severe ailments. If individuals in less affluent countries have access to these drugs, their health conditions might improve. Lowering drug prices would therefore be an act of compassion.\nOn the other hand, the existing pricing of medications is actually fair, reflecting their effectiveness.

Nonetheless, I firmly contend that a higher degree of regulation is necessary to shield the public from harmful content and foreign cultural influences that may be inappropriate.\nA compelling justification for stricter media oversight is the need to curtail the prevalence of violent and sexual content. Such content can have profound negative effects, particularly on adolescents during their formative years. For instance, a web-based cartoon called Happy Tree Friends is notoriously graphic, often depicting characters being brutally dismembered. Additionally, it is worth noting that foreign television programs are frequently imported, and viewers may adopt ideas that conflict with local cultural norms. Several years ago, a Japanese game show aired where participants threw cream cakes at losing contestants. This practice is highly detrimental to the environment.\nThe primary counterargument revolves around ensuring the safety of citizens. Specifically, authorities should ensure timely disclosure of critical information to the media, particularly during disasters or disease outbreaks. For example, during the 2003 SARS outbreak, the Chinese government restricted public access to information, which led to numerous fatalities. However, an alternative viewpoint is that withholding information can help prevent unnecessary panic and social unrest.\nBoth perspectives hold valid points.

In today's bustling and crowded environments, people often neglect their manners and conduct, leading to increased rudeness. As a result, some argue that we shouldn't expect politeness from others. I clearly disagree with this viewpoint, and here are my reasons.\nFirst of all, a well-mannered individual leaves a positive impression on others. Such impressions make it easy for a person to connect with others and quickly integrate into their community. For example, When I started at a new company, if I exhibit good manners and treat everyone respectfully, my colleagues will accept me, and even my employers will recognize my value. Conversely, if I am rude, I will struggle to get along with others. Ultimately, This behavior could lead to me being dismissed and losing my job.\nSecondly, politeness among individuals fosters mutual respect. Polite and kind words not only enhance the speaker's reputation but also uplift listeners who need encouragement. A thriving corporation is built on respect and a positive atmosphere. Numerous examples show that polite individuals are more likely to succeed, because their respectful behavior allows their partners or competitors to recognize their own worth.\nFinally, a civilized society requires order and decorum.

It comes as no surprise that this focus on famous individuals has raised concerns among many, particularly regarding its impact on children. This essay will assess both the adverse and beneficial effects of this phenomenon on young minds.\nBeing famous carries significant responsibility for public figures, as their fans are highly responsive to any actions taken by their idols. Scandals and gossip involving celebrities can rapidly reach the public, who tend to react very negatively. This indicates that celebrities caught in the spotlight for substance abuse or excessive drinking often face public condemnation. Thus, youngsters may learn that such behavior is unacceptable.\nConversely, the overwhelming media coverage of celebrities seems to negatively impact children's choices regarding their future careers. Recent studies indicate that, driven by the allure of fame and fortune, children now aspire more to become actors or sports stars than they did previously. Numerous schools geared towards creating stars, along with advertisements about celebrities, can mislead children into believing that these professions are in high demand and easily attainable. This situation may bewilder children, who should base their career choices not on media influence, but on their own passions and interests.\nIn summary, parents ought to be increasingly concerned about their children's perspective on the 'celebrity culture'.

Many people believe that it's regarded as one of New York's most successful malls. My experience was that during my visit there, I was able to find almost every brand or store, including Macy's and JCPenney.

Consequently, consumers can easily compare prices due to promotional sales before making purchases.

My belief is that priority should be given to international aid.\nInternational assistance holds significant importance because individuals in other nations may confront far graver issues.

{"id": "id_725", "input": "Over the past ten years, the workload for university students has consistently risen. Some people argue that university students shouldn't attend any classes until they pass their exams, while others believe students can join university courses without passing exams. In my opinion, students can gain university education without needing to pass exams first. The reasoning will be detailed as follows. \nFirstly, students don't always have expertise in every aspect of a subject. For instance, I have a passion for Physics. However, I'm not fond of electronics, since electronics are not frequently observable in everyday life. And I scored zero in physics when studying electronics. Yet, I consistently get perfect scores in other areas of physics. If I were unable to attend classes without passing the electronics exam, I would repeatedly fail the entire physics subject. Thankfully, at our university, class attendance is not dependent on exam scores. Thus, I can study physics without worrying about electronics. Eventually, I retook the electronics exam and succeeded.\nSecondly, if universities require passing exams to attend classes, students might remain uneducated. Failing most exams means missing out on many classes. And students would have little to occupy themselves on campus. Consequently, resulting in excessive online gaming day and night. Their academic performance would decrease. Ultimately, this student would become marginalized in society. All this stems from universities preventing class attendance. This is a failure not just of universities but the entire educational system.\nAdmittedly, university students may not excel if allowed to attend classes without passing exams. Nevertheless, the advantages of unrestricted class access outweigh the concern of lower scores.\nTo sum up, universities should permit students to attend classes without passing exams because not only are students not proficient in every subject area, but it also prevents students from remaining uneducated on campus.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay311", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 283, "to": 357}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 412, "to": 477}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 532, "to": 559}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 567, "to": 625}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 627, "to": 681}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 683, "to": 747}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 749, "to": 872}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 874, "to": 953}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 955, "to": 1015}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1017, "to": 1072}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1084, "to": 1173}], "label": "Claim", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1175, "to": 1227}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1229, "to": 1290}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1306, "to": 1356}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1358, "to": 1399}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1413, "to": 1462}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1464, "to": 1524}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1526, "to": 1602}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1616, "to": 1700}], "label": "Claim", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1716, "to": 1796}], "label": "Premise", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1809, "to": 1884}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 20}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1893, "to": 2018}], "label": "Claim", "id": 21}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 19, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 1, 10, 18, 20, 21]}

In a world striving to deter heinous crimes, it might be argued that the death penalty serves as a potent means to combat violence.

Despite what criminals cause to the society, specifically to the victims, is indeed significantly offensive, they are humans and their lives need to be valued. Additionally, execution does not resolve the consequences of crime, not to mention it could put the criminal's family through hardship while the pain of the victim's kin is never to be consoled.\nMoreover, capital punishment is certainly not the only option to control the amount of crimes, life imprisonment is just as effective by detaining the criminals in prison for the rest of their lives. Furthermore, in terms of punishment, living a miserable life with restriction to the world outside and sustaining the feeling of guilt every day in a dark bounded room are much more obsessing than being killed right away.\nThe third reason why the death penalty should be banned is the chance that innocent people are wrongly convicted.

However, there are those who argue that this perspective overlooks the ecological and environmental harm inflicted by tourism activities, along with the negative impacts on local communities and ecosystems. Although both viewpoints hold merit, I believe that with effective management and regulation, a thriving tourism sector can be a tremendous source of economic growth and prosperity for both rural and urban regions.\nThe most evident benefit is that tourism can significantly enhance economic development in a specific state or area. This occurs not only through direct spending by tourists but also by offering direct and indirect employment to the community in sectors such as retail, agriculture, and services. The rise in tax revenue and the growth of local markets for accommodations, luxury goods, and more are also outcomes of robust and well-regulated tourism initiatives. Additionally, tourism creates numerous direct and indirect job opportunities for the community, including in retail, hospitality, transportation, agriculture, and services. This proliferation of job opportunities enables more individuals to contribute significantly to society through their increased purchasing power. Consequently, this invigorates the economic cycle, fostering local economic prosperity in return.\nOpponents may argue against these points, highlighting the environmental and cultural degradation caused by tourism. Actually, in comparison to tourism, other alternatives like resource extraction and manufacturing are far greater threats to the environment. For example, paper mills discharge hundreds of thousands of tons of pollutants into rivers, leading to severe water contamination. Conversely, the vast majority of tourists, especially those who spend considerable time and money exploring rural villages, are well-educated.

This surge in population has led to the sacrifice of vast amounts of natural habitat to accommodate housing, agriculture, and industrial development. However, isn't it crucial to preserve the planet's land to ensure the survival of other species that share this world with us? In my view, we must undoubtedly revise our approach to the environment, and there are multiple reasons to support this stance.\nFirstly, preserving biodiversity is crucial for future generations. Failing to modify our actions will lead to the extinction of countless species that have existed on Earth for millions of years. By clearing natural habitats such as forests, jungles, and lakes for industrial and agricultural purposes, we disrupt and deplete ecosystems. For instance, a significant portion of the South American Rainforest is destroyed daily to supply wood and expand farmland. Failing to protect this essential part of the ecosystem will result in numerous endangered animals losing their habitats and ultimately facing extinction. Consequently, future generations will be deprived of the chance to observe and learn about these species.\nMoreover, maintaining a balanced and sustainable environment is vital for regulating weather patterns. Human activities contribute to pollution, which significantly disrupts Earth's weather systems and accelerates the undeniable phenomenon of global warming. This has repercussions not only for endangered species but also for human populations because we face challenges such as rising sea levels and shifts in climate patterns. For instance, recent United Nations studies project that by 2050, the average sea level will rise by over a meter. This will have severe consequences for coastal communities and fundamentally alter the global climate.\nIn summary, considering all the arguments presented, it is imperative that we transform our environmental practices, not only to safeguard endangered species but also to ensure the stability of our own living conditions.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay304", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 446, "to": 504}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 570, "to": 627}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 629, "to": 756}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 758, "to": 898}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 914, "to": 1022}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1024, "to": 1177}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1193, "to": 1283}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1295, "to": 1386}], "label": "Claim", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1388, "to": 1542}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1544, "to": 1629}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1638, "to": 1713}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1729, "to": 1828}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1830, "to": 1931}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1986, "to": 2152}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 13}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 7, 13]}

This perspective is understandable given the fierce competition in today's labor market; students must meet qualification requirements. Furthermore, the unemployment rate remains consistently high, which is why their parents desire their children to study subjects that can secure employment. \nEven though the aforementioned reasons hold some validity, I contend that there are numerous aspects far more significant than merely obtaining a job. To begin with, learning music, art, or sports holds substantial importance for students. it allows students to harness their potential by exploring the natural world around them. Additionally, to secure employment in the labor market, students need not only technical skills but also interpersonal skills, such as teamwork and presentation. For example, by participating in sports, students can grasp the concept of team spirit and acquire teamwork skills. Consequently, these subjects can fully realize students' capabilities. Lastly, a child's future is not predominantly dictated by the academic subjects they study in school; it is shaped by their own efforts and abilities.\nTo sum up, despite the fact that academic subjects are fundamental in shaping children's growth, I am inclined to believe that the impacts of studying music and sports are significant.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay349", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 177, "to": 298}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 328, "to": 406}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 415, "to": 474}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 511, "to": 610}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 625, "to": 672}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 693, "to": 767}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 844, "to": 919}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 936, "to": 1008}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1010, "to": 1098}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1114, "to": 1260}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1275, "to": 1376}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1392, "to": 1447}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1457, "to": 1598}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1633, "to": 1695}], "label": "Claim", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1727, "to": 1783}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 14}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 11, 13, 14]}

As this technology progresses, traditional newspapers and magazines are facing challenges in maintaining their relevance. While some predict that printed media will soon fade away due to the dominance of internet-based platforms, others believe it will endure. I am inclined to agree with the viewpoint that newspapers and magazines will become obsolete over time. My position is supported by an examination of how the internet delivers timely updates on current events and provides easy access to historical information.\nOne of the key roles of media is to disseminate updates about ongoing events promptly, especially during crises. This availability allows readers to stay informed and act appropriately. For instance, when Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 disappeared, people were desperate to learn details about the tragic event. The relatives and friends of those aboard the flight were particularly anxious to uncover the truth. Moreover, In such scenarios, digital platforms can respond much faster than traditional print media. Rather than waiting for the next newspaper edition, individuals can access credible updates online within hours. This demonstrates why digital platforms are set to dominate over newspapers and magazines.\nMany people wish to access past news for reasons such as research or personal curiosity. For example, a researcher might want to investigate how the small Japanese village of Oramaki struggled after World War II. Obtaining such historical information from print media is challenging, as one must know precisely where to look. However, online platforms offer powerful search tools that allow users to quickly locate detailed information on their topic of interest. This capability is something traditional newspapers and magazines simply cannot provide.\nIn summary, internet-based media, with its rapid responsiveness and extensive information, will replace newspapers and magazines as the primary source of news and knowledge for compelling reasons.

Part-time jobs provide them with valuable opportunities to apply the knowledge they are acquiring at university. Furthermore, which is particularly crucial given the current lack of adequate practical resources available at universities. Consequently, students who have part-time jobs possess both theoretical knowledge and practical skills. Additionally, having work experience during student years gives them a significant edge when seeking employment post-graduation.\nSecondly, students who undertake part-time work tend to be more self-assured and self-reliant than their peers. Through regular interaction with colleagues in a corporate setting where they can freely express new ideas, students can greatly enhance their confidence. Moreover, work conditions demand students to think independently, work autonomously, and solve problems, which is immensely beneficial when these traits are applied to their university studies.\nFinally, taking up extra jobs assists students financially in terms of housing expenses. Indeed, the combination of high tuition fees and rising living costs is increasingly becoming a substantial burden on students. The earnings from extra jobs, although often modest, can help alleviate these financial challenges to some extent. Furthermore, this allows students to be less dependent on their families and prepares them well for a self-sufficient future.\nIn summary, I am convinced that holding a part-time job during university years provides students with numerous distinct advantages.

They seek female candidates for roles requiring a gentle demeanor, such as counseling, teaching, and designing. Consequently, universities align with job market demands and tailor subjects to fit gender roles.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that universities should allow individuals to freely choose their subjects.

{"id": "id_739", "input": "University students hold varying perspectives on whether attending classes should be mandatory or optional. Some argue that students should be required to attend, while others believe it should be left to individual choice. In my view, this is because university education is at a level where students are mature enough to make their own decisions. Consequently, I firmly support the idea that attending classes should be a voluntary choice for students.\nTo start with, attending lectures can sometimes be a misuse of time. For example, certain lecturers at the university merely read out content from course reference books. Additionally, they fail to present the material in a way that is comprehensible to students, which ultimately leads to this results in a loss of valuable time. Since university students have reached a stage of maturity, they possess the capability to independently study and understand textbooks. Furthermore, modern technology enables students to access a wide array of information from diverse sources. For instance, students can utilize the Internet to read articles, access e-books, and watch video tutorials that convey information effectively. On the other hand, some lecturers present their lessons in an engaging and highly informative manner. attending such lectures can be highly beneficial and students can feel their time was well-spent.\nMoreover, university schedules often occupy the entire day with lectures. Additionally, many university students work part-time to cover their educational expenses, making students need to balance work, study, and lecture attendance essential. Therefore, they must organize their time to accommodate lectures, study sessions, and work. At the same time, instead of attending monotonous classes, students could engage in extracurricular activities like debates, swimming competitions, or basketball matches, which can help such activities allow them to connect with peers and expand their social network.\nTo summarize, although a few exceptional lecturers provide highly educational and engaging sessions, many others fail to captivate students, resulting in wasted time. by the time students enter university, they are mentally and physically mature and they are equipped with enough knowledge to make their own choices.

{"id": "id_740", "input": "The question of the appropriate age for retirement is a topic of significant debate in society today. Some people argue that individuals should have the freedom to decide when to retire, while others disagree with this perspective. Personally, the ideal retirement age should be set around 60 years. I, for one, firmly believe that age should serve as a criterion for retiring at this specified age for several reasons, which I will elaborate on below.\nTo begin with, when older employees predominantly occupy the workforce, it reduces job prospects for recent graduates. As a consequence, many of them will have to pursue careers drastically different from their field of study. For instance, a medical graduate might feel deeply discouraged after dedicating five years to studying medicine, only to end up in a different profession due to limited job openings. Additionally, a lack of genuine interest in a job they didn't choose could lead to declining performance standards.\nMoreover, not all senior employees maintain good physical health. Beyond this age, many face a higher risk of developing various health issues such as stress-related and cardiovascular diseases. For example, the pressures faced by an aging teacher can significantly impact their well-being. As a result, they may not be able to perform their duties effectively. Furthermore, the educational institution may have to cover medical expenses, leading to financial losses. Therefore, it would indeed be beneficial to offer opportunities to the younger generation in later years.\nThough, the skills and knowledge of retired senior workers should not be overlooked. Their extensive experience and expertise in fields like engineering, medicine, and law can greatly aid the younger workforce. Therefore, it is advisable for retirees to visit companies or hospitals to conduct regular sessions with current staff, bridging the gap and imparting their knowledge.\nIn summary, it is clear that an age limit for retirement should be established. There will eventually come a time when the older generation should pass on responsibilities to newcomers eager to demonstrate their capabilities. After all, retirement not only signifies the conclusion of a professional chapter but also offers an individual the chance to make up for personal sacrifices made during their career.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay101", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 244, "to": 298}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 312, "to": 398}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 468, "to": 570}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 590, "to": 678}], "label": "Claim", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 694, "to": 861}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 877, "to": 977}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 989, "to": 1043}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1045, "to": 1172}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1187, "to": 1268}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1283, "to": 1339}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1354, "to": 1445}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1458, "to": 1551}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1561, "to": 1636}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1638, "to": 1762}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1775, "to": 1930}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1944, "to": 2010}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 15}], "edges": [{"source": 3, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 3, 11, 12, 15]}

Today, everyone is in constant competition. As the global population continues to rise, competition becomes increasingly intense. If you cannot manage your work, someone else will quickly take your place. People must exert far more effort to maintain their standard of living. Consequently, life in earlier times was less complicated than it is today.\nSecondly, today's environment is severely damaged. When I look outside, I don't see the sky, trees, or mountains, but towering, cold buildings. Every day, I walk on hard surfaces, breathe polluted air, and exist in confined spaces. Even more concerning, it has been demonstrated that living in such conditions can lead to mental health issues. Hence, the environment our grandparents experienced was more pleasant than today.\nThe third reason concerns the speed of life. Today, we can access global news, communicate online, or travel worldwide by air; nevertheless, it also implies that global events impact our lives.

Some argue that higher education is crucial for the nation's progress, while others contend that it merely contributes to rising unemployment rates. This essay will explore both perspectives to reach a definitive conclusion.\nInitially, supporters of the view that university education is impractical present several arguments. They assert that there are plenty of career options available for individuals without a university degree, such as mechanics, sales representatives, or engineers, and moreover, there is a scarcity of jobs suitable for graduates. To make matters worse, the market for highly educated individuals has become overly competitive, making it difficult to secure employment post-graduation. Consequently, it detracts from national productivity when young individuals spend excessive time seeking high-paying positions, which can ultimately be a waste of time.\nConversely, those who oppose this viewpoint argue that universities offer more than just career skills; they impart academic knowledge essential to humanity, such as bioscience, political science, and medicine. These academic values are vital for global advancement. Furthermore, numerous studies conducted within academic institutions have resulted in groundbreaking discoveries and innovations that contribute to modern societal development. Another key advantage of universities is that the variety of experiences gained during university life enhances the competencies of the younger generation due to there are numerous opportunities through internships, in-depth discussions, independent living, and exchange scholarships.\nIn conclusion, both arguments regarding the necessity of university education have valid points; however, I am inclined to support the latter perspective.

Let's delve into this debate.\nTo begin with, a significant number of people assert that colleges and universities should admit students only if they demonstrate excellence. Their rationale is that pursuing higher education demands significant financial investment. Additionally, Colleges and universities prefer not to have unqualified individuals squander their resources on costly courses and waste time.

As a result, average students might miss out on acquiring advanced knowledge from colleges and universities.\nConversely, there are those who advocate that all students deserve an equal chance to pursue higher education. Certainly, higher education requires considerable financial and time investment, yet students with moderate abilities should be given a chance to try. Anyone with strong ambition can achieve their goals, even if not initially classified as a top student, as personal growth is possible. Furthermore, A supportive environment at colleges and universities motivates students to study hard for a promising future. Therefore, average students should be afforded opportunities for training in colleges and universities.\nIn summary, my personal stance is that colleges and universities should be accessible to all students aspiring to achieve their goals.

{"id": "id_752", "input": "The debate over whether individuals should engage in hobbies and partake in physical activities continues to spark discussion. People hold diverse opinions on the matter. While some argue that our focus should be solely on our careers, I beg to differ. Engaging in hobbies and participating in physical activities provides numerous advantages.\nTo begin with, pursuing hobbies and physical activities is an excellent method to maintain physical fitness. Staring at a computer screen for prolonged periods can lead to a state of disorientation, hence partaking in sports and hobbies helps prevent obesity and vision impairment. A neighbor named Tom previously worked as a computer engineer for a large corporation. His daily routine included consuming fast food and a lack of physical exercise. Realizing his weight was hindering his social life, he resolved to shed some pounds. He adopted a habit of jogging every morning. After a month, he slimmed down and started dating.\nAdditionally, Engaging in the same activity for extended periods can become monotonous, hobbies and sports have the power to rejuvenate our minds. For instance, In educational settings, students are given breaks between classes to unwind and gear up for the next session. Humans are not machines; endurance for continuous work around the clock is impossible. Taking time for sports or hobbies can recharge our mental energy.\nFinally, cultivating at least one personal hobby is essential, not for boasting, but to convey emotions during times of stress or sadness. Playing a musical instrument serves this purpose well, and I personally play the classical guitar. Faced with academic challenges, I often turn to my guitar and play 'Green Sleeves'. This practice lifts my spirits and boosts my confidence.\nEven though it might require significant time investment to cultivate personal hobbies, but such endeavors contribute to a healthier physique, a refreshed mindset, and a method to alleviate stress and melancholy.

{"id": "id_754", "input": "In today's interconnected world, everyone is familiar with the term 'globalization', which signifies the increasing closeness of nations and the growing influence they have on each other in various aspects. This interconnectedness has led both governmental and non-governmental organizations to prioritize harmony and aid to impoverished nations. It is indeed the case that simply providing aid to poor nations can be exploited by powerful countries. Moreover, a substantial influx of resources and funds can lead to corruption and political dependency in impoverished nations. Nevertheless, I concur that assisting underdeveloped countries brings about positive outcomes that outweigh the potential drawbacks for several reasons.\nTo begin with, impoverished nations struggle with a lack of essential materials and infrastructure necessary to initiate businesses and foster economic growth. Escaping poverty necessitates support for foundational industries, including electricity, transportation infrastructure, natural resources, technology, and corporate buildings. Providing aid helps these countries address their economic challenges and enables them to develop their own enterprises. In reality, South Korea was among the poorest nations, even compared to some African countries in the 1960s. It has since transformed into a robust economy, after receiving aid from other nations for a decade.\nSecondly, aid initiatives offer an opportunity to reflect on the plight of the less fortunate. When individuals in wealthy countries consider the hardships faced by those in poverty, they are less likely to take their own prosperity for granted. It not only highlights the significance of harmony and compassion but also serves as an excellent occasion to embrace the humanistic principles of globalization.\nThirdly, these initiatives may also have practical advantages. In a globalized economy, the financial systems of various nations are interconnected and have mutual impacts. When the U.S. mortgage crisis occurred, it caused economic instability in several European and Asian countries, with some requiring international aid to prevent bankruptcy.\nIn conclusion, there are three essential benefits of aid: strengthening the economies of impoverished nations, fostering humane values among people, and maintaining a robust global economy.

In my opinion, I contend that violence in movies adversely impacts young people's behavior, emotions, and academic performance.\nFirstly, children's behavior is a primary concern for parents who strive to do their utmost. Nowadays, children are more exposed to television programs. Imagine a child idolizes an actor who portrays violent characters. In such scenarios, the child would mimic the actor's actions to emulate them. Consequently, unexpectedly, the child's behavior becomes influenced by the violence.\nAdditionally, humans, especially young individuals, are highly impressionable. For example, death is always a distressing event. Moreover, murder is even more troubling. Thus, if such scenes are shown on TV, they are likely to negatively affect the viewer, particularly if they are a child.\nFinally, aside from all the previously mentioned points, the education of young people should always be monitored. For instance, a child watches a horror film. Conversely, he needs to study for an exam. In this situation, since he keeps dwelling on the film or its events, it's clear that he wouldn't be able to focus on his studies effectively. Therefore, the academic performance of a young person could be severely impacted.\nTo sum up, I firmly assert that the increase of violence in films undeniably has detrimental effects on young people's academic performance, emotions, and behavior.

Some individuals argue that zoos can be highly entertaining and play a crucial ecological role, while others contend that confining animals is entirely unethical. Both perspectives will be explored before reaching a fair conclusion.\nFirst, opponents of zoos assert that it is unethical to keep animals in captivity because animals deserve recognition as non-human persons and should possess the right to freedom. It is extremely unjust to remove them from their natural habitats and confine them to small cages. This is due to the fact that many zoos, particularly in developing nations, fail to provide the necessary care and attention that their animals need. The animals frequently suffer from malnutrition and lack adequate medical treatment both in quality and quantity. Furthermore, sometimes animals native to hot climates are forced to endure the cold winters of places like Europe.\nConversely, supporters maintain that zoos offer enjoyable entertainment to the public and contribute to ecological balance. Many individuals, especially children, delight in visiting zoos to see their favorite animals, newborn creatures, and species from across the globe. Zoos offer educational insights about the lives of diverse animals to the public. Additionally, zoos play a crucial role in preserving various animal breeds and preventing their extinction.

Consequently, zoos are essential for maintaining ecological equilibrium.\nIn conclusion, both sides present compelling arguments, but personally, I believe that zoos bring about more benefits than drawbacks.

Smaller enterprises typically serve local communities, whereas larger corporations operate globally, catering not just to their nation but also to international markets. I personally favor working for a large corporation for various reasons.\nFirstly, it's significantly easier to secure a position in a large corporation than in a smaller firm. Large corporations are constantly on the lookout for skilled professionals to support their efforts in distributing, managing, and marketing their products across various nations. For instance, when a large corporation decides to establish a new branch overseas, they require additional staff in that location. Essentially, A larger corporation equates to more job openings.\nSecondly, I believe that a larger corporation is likely to offer higher wages than a smaller business. The size of a corporation often indicates its substantial success. This implies that this suggests that the corporation can afford to pay its employees more generously. For example, it's reasonable to assume that a well-known global corporation would offer higher salaries than a small local business.\nThirdly, I enjoy exploring different parts of the world. large corporations boast international acclaim, hosting global conferences, meetings, and workshops, which enable me to travel to different countries and meet new individuals. These events also allow me to acquire new skills relevant to my profession.\nTo sum up, I can confidently assert that I prefer working for a large corporation over a smaller one.

{"id": "id_760", "input": "The topic under consideration is whether university students should be mandated to attend classes. This question is intriguing because it impacts numerous students globally. Despite this, various policies exist on the subject. A crucial element might be whether one aims to maximize the knowledge acquired or the valuable experiences gained by students. In my opinion, students should have the option not to attend classes because it enhances student life quality, boosts their motivation to learn, and imparts critical life skills.\nFirstly, adopting a flexible policy is highly practical. Monitoring attendance involves extensive bureaucracy. Particularly in large classes, it's impractical to ensure everyone is present. Therefore, making attendance optional conserves both time and resources.\nSecondly, some students may find they learn more effectively at home, for example, by studying textbooks. This issue is particularly prevalent when the instructor lacks enthusiasm. Allowing students the choice to skip class gives them the chance to avoid ineffective teaching. Consequently, they can use this time to study more productively and explore the course material independently.\nAdditionally, having the liberty to miss classes increases flexibility, thereby enhancing the quality of student life. Occasionally, an exciting Thursday night party shouldn't have to end early just because of a Friday morning lecture. With a flexible approach, students can defer learning to the afternoon, providing a sense of freedom and improving time management. Studies indicate that greater satisfaction with life aspects correlates with improved academic performance.\nFinally, psychology identifies two types of motivation: intrinsic, which originates from one's own mindset, and extrinsic, which stems from external praise and recognition. Intrinsic motivation is far more beneficial as it enhances learning and overall well-being. Nonetheless, to develop intrinsic motivation, students need to recognize their strengths and goals. Granting students the autonomy to decide on class attendance may encourage them to reflect on their reasons for studying and foster self-motivation. These skills are vital throughout their academic journey and their entire lives.\nIn conclusion, it is evident that class attendance should be a matter of choice for students. I believe this due to the enhancement of students' present experiences and the acquisition of essential skills and knowledge for their future.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay205", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 369, "to": 422}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 431, "to": 531}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 806, "to": 900}], "label": "Claim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 902, "to": 975}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 977, "to": 1071}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1087, "to": 1182}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1198, "to": 1301}], "label": "Claim", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1303, "to": 1418}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1420, "to": 1550}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1552, "to": 1658}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1833, "to": 1923}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1938, "to": 2023}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2025, "to": 2172}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2174, "to": 2253}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2270, "to": 2347}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2349, "to": 2490}], "label": "Claim", "id": 15}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 6, 12, 14, 15]}
{"id": "id_761", "input": "In today's world, transportation has become a significant topic of public interest. The debate over whether governments should allocate more funds to enhance traffic infrastructure or prioritize the expansion of public transport systems is ongoing. It seems logical to assert that governments should channel more funds into buses, trains, and subway systems. These public transport options cater to a vast segment of the population thus they contribute to reducing traffic congestion and lowering carbon emissions. Both of these aspects hold considerable importance.\nPrimarily, curbing carbon emissions is crucial for safeguarding our atmosphere. The reality is that an increase in cars and motorcycles on the roads leads to further damage to the ozone layer. Investment in road improvements may result in more individuals opting to drive their private vehicles to work. This inevitably results in higher carbon emissions, potentially causing skin cancer and harming the environment. Conversely, With better buses, trains, and subways available, there's a tendency for people to rely less on personal vehicles, thereby reducing carbon output. Clearly, focusing financial resources on enhancing public transportation has a beneficial impact on our planet. \nMoreover, the policy would be instrumental in alleviating traffic congestion. It is evident that traffic gridlock is a significant issue in numerous large cities. The primary reason for this challenge is that there is an overwhelming number of vehicles occupying the roads. To address this issue, governments must shift public focus towards public transport to cut down on car and motorcycle usage. Enhancing roads and highways might not effectively address the root cause of traffic congestion.\nIn summary, I acknowledge that well-constructed roads and highways facilitate easier mobility. However, public transport systems offer even greater benefits. They not only alleviate traffic congestion but also preserve the atmosphere.

Personally, I lean towards the latter for the following reasons.\nFirstly, one's temperament plays a role in my preference for solo work over group efforts. As an introvert, I require considerable time and energy to adapt to new environments and particularly to unfamiliar people. For example, during a group presentation with strangers, I ended up working separately and completed more than half the project myself instead of trying to socialize with new team members. Consequently, my effectiveness increases when my working style aligns with my temperament.\nMoreover, working independently helps me avoid the time and effort required for various aspects inherent in team activities. To put it differently, I don't have to allocate tasks and responsibilities, share accountability and rewards, or invest time in team-building exercises. These benefits become particularly crucial when time is limited. About a year ago, I had the opportunity to participate in a student brainstorming competition.

Nonetheless, I believe that reading fiction provides more enjoyment than watching films for several reasons.\nTo begin with, fictional literature offers greater attention to detail. Indeed, one can gain a thorough understanding of the characters, settings, and eras of a novel while reading it. The majority of novels provide descriptions not just of the main characters but also of other individuals in the story and the locations where each scene unfolds. For instance, after reading Animal Farm, which is based on the Russian revolution, I was able to comprehend the leaders and various segments of Russian society. On the other hand, films only offer a brief overview of their narratives and characters.\nFurthermore, reading a novel is more practical. Certain novels contain approximately 100 pages, making it impossible for readers to complete them in just one hour. Nonetheless, individuals can continue reading their novels whenever they have spare time, such as while commuting on buses or trains. As an example, I embarked on reading a novel last week. I lack sufficient time to finish a novel in a single day, so I usually read it while returning home from my English class.

Although numerous medical treatments, such as those for cancer and HIV, have been developed through animal testing, many scientists assert its necessity for advancing human health.

Each year, millions of animals are killed by cosmetic companies, farms, or medical schools for product testing, without yielding any useful results. Conducting tests on animals demands substantial financial resources, as they require feeding, care, and exposure to drugs or experimental compounds.\nSecondly, animals are housed in unnatural environments. Recent research highlights that animals suffer from neglect and poor treatment, affecting their drug reactions. In March 2003, a laboratory technician recorded a video showing primates in cages without pain relief, including a baboon with a metal cylinder attached to its head. As a result, I believe that the sacrifice of animals is both costly and distressing.\nFurthermore, the argument exists that testing on animals contravenes many ethical and genetic standards.

Prolonged TV viewing without completing homework is a significant concern for many parents regarding their children. During my own childhood, I was a prime example. Upon returning home from school, my immediate action was to switch on the TV and remain glued for hours. I could spend endless hours watching TV, yet struggled to focus on homework for even a short duration. I could recall all the TV channels and their programs, but barely remember any words from my textbooks. Consequently, my academic performance suffered greatly due to insufficient study time.\nFurthermore, Television sometimes features content laden with violence and sexual themes, which can be detrimental to children. Children lack the maturity to discern between good and bad influences, which leads to out of curiosity, they might mimic behaviors seen on TV. A growing number of children have taken up smoking, mainly because they emulate the actions of actors portrayed on TV or in films. Alarmingly, Statistics reveal an increasing number of children with violent tendencies, attributed to TV shows and movies. It is evident that Numerous TV programs and films negatively impact children's mental and physical well-being. How can we expect children to excel academically if they exhibit such unusual behaviors?\nSome might argue that, in terms of social interaction with peers, children benefit from watching TV and movies for their rich content, which provides conversational topics. I agree with this perspective to a certain degree. Nonetheless, this does not imply that children should indulge excessively without monitoring the content they consume. \nWhen deliberating whether children's TV and movie watching should be limited, I firmly support such restrictions. Given that children struggle with time management and lack the maturity to make sound judgments, necessitating careful supervision while watching TV and movies.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay249", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 415, "to": 491}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 508, "to": 584}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 586, "to": 701}], "label": "Claim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 751, "to": 854}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 856, "to": 957}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 959, "to": 1061}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1063, "to": 1148}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1163, "to": 1276}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1278, "to": 1347}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1364, "to": 1419}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1421, "to": 1471}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1488, "to": 1550}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1564, "to": 1673}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1694, "to": 1784}], "label": "Claim", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1941, "to": 2046}], "label": "Claim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2112, "to": 2216}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2219, "to": 2331}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2344, "to": 2492}], "label": "Claim", "id": 17}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 13, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 13, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 13, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 13, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 15, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 2, 13, 14, 16, 17]}

Some individuals assert that this issue arises due to the frequent use of firearms by police officers when handling criminal activities. Personally, I am inclined to disagree with this viewpoint, as I believe that other elements contribute to the slight rise in violence.\nOn one hand, I acknowledge that police officers bear the responsibility of combating violence in both urban and suburban areas through the use of firearms. A clear instance of this is seen in the United States, where a man killed over ten people in a movie theater using a weapon, while a police officer shot him in the foot to incapacitate him. Clearly, police can compel criminals to give up, because they are armed, which deters criminals from fleeing and posing a threat to the public. Consequently, some military-grade weapons should be encouraged for police officers to safeguard the public and reduce violence rates.\nConversely, there are several reasons why violent incidents have surged significantly within communities. To begin with, the unemployment rate has climbed to 15 percent in numerous globalized and non-globalized nations. Many highly skilled and educated individuals struggle to earn enough money to live comfortably. Additionally, living expenses in major cities are exceedingly high, prompting some individuals living below the poverty line to resort to desperate measures to cover their basic needs. Many beggars, for example, opt to pickpocket on public transportation.\nTo sum up, it appears to me that the firearms utilized by police have not been the catalyst for increased violence.

However, today, everyone can utilize the internet to set up their own email account for free and send messages instantly, with the assurance of knowing whether the emails have been successfully delivered.\nA further pivotal aspect of technology is the transfer of money. Nowadays, students can apply to universities abroad with much greater ease. This is facilitated not only by sending emails but also by using credit cards to pay all necessary fees online. Consequently, thanks to the emergence of the internet and online payment systems, many tasks can be effortlessly completed from home.\nAnother technological advancement that benefits people globally pertains to medical equipment. Biomedical engineers have significantly contributed to increasing life expectancy worldwide. For instance, one of their remarkable innovations is the development of artificial heart valves, marking a milestone in heart surgeries. Historically, doctors used pig heart valves for implantation, but patients typically survived only up to three years after the procedure.

Personally, I propose a different approach to addressing this issue. Advertising is indeed necessary for society, but it's crucial that we carefully regulate the content and decide which goods and services we wish to present to consumers..\nTo begin with, I firmly believe that advertising for alcohol, cigarettes, and adult-themed products and services should be forbidden because such advertisements can negatively influence our younger generation. Young people might be lured into purchasing cigarettes or alcohol, potentially leading to regular consumption. Thankfully, there are nations that take this matter seriously and have outlawed advertising of alcohol, cigarettes, and adult material.\nConversely, advertising enables companies, businesses, and individuals to promote their products and services. Advertisements introduce us to new offerings, allowing us to compare and decide what suits us best.\nCurrently, advertising is indispensable not only for businesses but also for governmental entities. For instance, tourism constitutes one-third of the Czech Republic's economic activity. To attract visitors to its attractions, the Czech government must promote and market its services internationally. Only advertising that is strategically planned and precisely targeted can draw more foreign visitors to the nation.\nIn summary, my view is that advertising is essential for contemporary society.

The issue of traffic congestion, spurred by overpopulation, has caught the attention of numerous urban planners. Some argue that the only way to tackle the daunting challenge of traffic jams is to decrease the need for people to venture out onto the streets. Nonetheless, I strongly oppose this view as there are still two other effective approaches to address this problem.\nTo begin with, public transportation plays a crucial role in reducing the number of vehicles on the road. Buses and trains have been integrated into urban infrastructure for quite some time and have proven to be the most effective options available. Clearly, a single bus can accommodate at least 30 passengers, whereas a train has the capacity for nine to ten times that amount. Furthermore, since highway trains operate underground, the streets above are left for buses and non-fuel-based vehicles. Combined, these measures will help reduce the overcrowded appearance of most cities today.\nAdditionally, we seldom appreciate the beneficial presence of suburban zones. It is suggested that relocating some large shopping centers or universities to the commuter belt would make city streets less crowded and bustling than they are presently. Generally speaking, when major attractions are spread evenly across a wide area, it encourages the development of residential zones, thereby relieving pressure on public infrastructure. The city itself will be spared from handling the surge of immigrants and unemployed individuals.\nIn summary, urban planners can still consider the use of public transport and the development of suburban areas.

Therefore, the importance of stress management has recently become more prominent in our awareness.\nMoreover, stress has detrimental effects on our health. It's recognized that modern life is often filled with hassles, frustrations, and demands. This contributes to why many people feel overwhelmed by relentless stress. Thus, some individuals suffer from physical ailments like insomnia and headaches. Depression, the most severe issue, even drives some to consider suicide. As a result, it is crucial to alleviate and manage stress to achieve a balance between mind and body. To avoid succumbing to pessimism, we can try to overcome our distress by sharing our worries with friends or family, exercising regularly, and attempting to view our challenges from a different perspective.\nFor the reasons mentioned above, I am convinced that mastering stress management is a vital skill for everyone to learn in order to address their stress effectively.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay179", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 138, "to": 251}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 275, "to": 371}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 373, "to": 435}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 446, "to": 544}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 560, "to": 637}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 639, "to": 866}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 868, "to": 968}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 970, "to": 1049}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1062, "to": 1149}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1161, "to": 1205}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1207, "to": 1295}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1297, "to": 1370}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1378, "to": 1452}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1454, "to": 1525}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1540, "to": 1627}], "label": "Claim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1889, "to": 2000}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 15}], "edges": [{"source": 4, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 4, 8, 14, 15]}
{"id": "id_781", "input": "Teaching can be approached in numerous ways. Some individuals advocate for a methodical and precise presentation of theories in the classroom, whereas others argue that integrating practical applications of these theories is more persuasive. Personally, I concur with the latter approach that the most effective method for educators to engage students in a subject is to illustrate how it can be relevant and applicable to their lives beyond the classroom.\nTo begin with, by demonstrating the subject's relevance to everyday life, students will form a vivid impression of the topic, thereby increasing their interest and eagerness to learn. Consider chemistry as an example; simply memorizing substance names and structural formulas can be dull, whereas showing where and how these chemical reactions occur around them can spark curiosity and help them absorb classroom theories. During my time in high school, my chemistry teacher conducted an experiment showing how detergent dissolves oil, later explaining the process with formal structural formulas. This learning method is engaging and ultimately yields positive outcomes. I associated the visual aspects of the experiment with the formula, and even now, despite not studying chemistry anymore, I rarely forget it.\nMoreover, by linking theories to real-life events, students can apply their knowledge and enhance their problem-solving skills. This approach captures students' interest because it's the task that involves real-world engagement. For instance, in law courses, students learn about their rights and obligations and are instructed on applying the law to various situations they may encounter. When confronted with any such situations, they can independently assess and decide how to respond.\nIn summary, utilizing real-life experiences and scenarios to convey knowledge is an excellent strategy to captivate students' attention and maintain their enthusiasm for learning, not only due to the fact that it not only strengthens their grasp of the knowledge but also encourages them to apply it independently.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay253", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 293, "to": 455}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 472, "to": 639}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 641, "to": 878}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 880, "to": 1053}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1055, "to": 1127}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1129, "to": 1269}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1281, "to": 1397}], "label": "Claim", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1399, "to": 1440}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1449, "to": 1498}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1514, "to": 1659}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1661, "to": 1758}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1772, "to": 1938}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1970, "to": 2073}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 6, 11, 12]}

Some opt for a conventional approach, waiting for opportunities to arise, while others strive to stand out from the crowd. Which path is more likely to lead to success? In my view, I assert that being distinctively unique sets you on the path to success.\nFirstly, standing out positively from the crowd often signifies that you've accomplished something that surpasses others. Living in a competitive world is akin to playing a survival game. Only those equipped with the most effective tools can thrive. Failing to make yourself remarkable or to stand apart from others means you risk being easily replaced and outperformed by someone superior. For instance, during my college years, I was consistently chosen to present our group reports because I was the sole member of my team able to deliver the presentation clearly and smoothly.\nSecondly, being unique establishes your own value that cannot be replicated by anyone else. Put differently, once you stand out as unique, success involves actively setting trends rather than passively awaiting recognition and appreciation from others. Consider the renowned technology giant, Apple, as an example. Its immense success stems from achieving exceptional qualities that remain unmatched by competitors. Apple's operating systems run more smoothly than any other, and its designs consistently win consumer popularity. The distinctiveness of Apple's design is what generates its unique value.\nIn summary, embracing uniqueness and individuality is the superior path to success.

{"id": "id_783", "input": "I concur with the notion that while life may seem daunting at times, those challenging moments ultimately transform into valuable lessons for the future. My viewpoint is grounded in the belief that every difficult experience enhances our skills, sharpens our decision-making, and makes us better equipped for life's challenges.\nA prime illustration of this is how infants assimilate fundamental survival skills during their early years. Each day presents new hurdles for them like mastering the art of walking, eating, and similar tasks, but these early-life obstacles impart crucial survival lessons that are beneficial throughout their lives. For instance, as they attempt to walk, they often stumble and endure several falls. However, they gradually refine their technique and eventually learn to walk.\nAll innovations and experiments stem from numerous failed observations. No renowned scientist achieves success on the first try. Scientists often conduct numerous trials before arriving at the desired outcome. It has been noted that Thomas Edison tested approximately 10,000 bulbs before successfully inventing the light bulb. Thus, the initial experiments were likely challenging and discouraging for him, yet he explored various possibilities and gained new insights with each attempt, despite the failures, ultimately achieving a breakthrough.\nOur arduous experiences unknowingly fortify and strengthen us. Although we might be enduring the toughest phase of our lives, reflecting on those instances later makes us feel more assured about our decisions and ourselves. Transitioning to a college hostel after school was initially quite disconcerting for me because it was my first time being away from my parents and living with unfamiliar individuals. Initially, I felt quite vulnerable and emotionally distracted, but gradually I adapted to my roommates and established connections. I also became more relaxed and sociable with others, enhancing my communication and social interaction skills.\nTo wrap up my thoughts on this matter, I would like to emphasize that every life experience, whether positive or negative, offers us lessons to learn and retain.

The debate continues on whether the government should allocate funds to safeguard these minority languages. In my view, all languages, irrespective of how widely they are spoken, deserve protection from extinction.\nThere are several arguments suggesting that allocating resources to preserve regional languages might be seen as financially imprudent. Firstly, it's important to consider that expanding the usage of these languages by the government can become quite costly due to the fact that educational programs would need to be implemented to ensure the younger generation continues to learn and use these languages. For instance, certain regions in Southern Vietnam have been making efforts to help secondary school students of Khmer descent speak their native language alongside Vietnamese, which means the local government has faced challenges with the high costs associated with hiring language teachers, providing facilities, and developing suitable materials. Secondly, it's clear that for various purposes like communication, trade, cooperation, and transactions, it would be undeniably simpler for society to operate in a single language.\nHowever, despite these points, I firmly believe that efforts should be made by the government to preserve minority languages. This stems from the understanding that language represents much more than merely a form of communication. Moreover, the development of a language takes thousands of years; hence, it merits respect and preservation. Finally, language is a crucial element in shaping the world's diverse and unique cultures.

During these events, individuals from various nationalities, backgrounds, and religions coexist peacefully. This allows people to gain deeper insights into a country's culture, which is advantageous for mitigating tensions between countries. For instance, in the FIFA World Cup 2010, relations between North Korea and South Korea were fraught due to the warship incident. North Korea was suspected worldwide of being behind the hostile act. Yet, as a result of the event, North Korea exhibited camaraderie and enthusiasm. These moments allow outsiders rare opportunities to learn about the country. This significantly contributes to easing tensions.\nIn addition to reducing discord, Such events also enable fans to express patriotic sentiments safely. As they gather to cheer for their teams, they display patriotic fervor. Despite fierce rivalry, emotions are safely expressed due to the shared love of sports. Furthermore, Everyone knows that sporting events capture global attention and media coverage. Fans strive to project a positive image of their homeland.

While some individuals believe that dedicating substantial time to food preparation is essential, I contend that people are inclined to allocate less time to cooking meals. There are several reasons supporting my perspective, with two notable ones standing out.\nThe primary reason is that thanks to scientific and technological advancements, sophisticated kitchen tools like modern microwaves and advanced pressure cookers have been developed to assist individuals in preparing and cooking meals swiftly. Consequently, today, people typically spend just an hour preparing meals rather than two or three hours, as was common a decade ago. In fact, in recent times, there has been a noticeable rise in the number of individuals across various demographics recognizing the significant advantages these technologies offer for household chores. This trend continues to grow alongside ongoing advancements in science and technology. Hence, it is likely that dedicating less time to cooking will become a prevalent trend in the near future.\nAdditionally, another reason is that many young individuals prefer dining out at restaurants because they wish to allocate more time to their careers or studies for self-improvement. A recent survey reveals that 89% of people now believe that, given the competitive and stressful environment they face, they must invest considerable time in working diligently, updating their skills, and acquiring diverse abilities. Therefore, they struggle to find time to prepare and cook meals. Even when they have some free time, they prefer socializing with friends to relax and alleviate work and study stress.\nSome might argue that spending ample time cooking can ensure the nutritional value and quality of food for one's family. To a certain extent, this holds truth. However, in reality, utilizing technology and advanced equipment does not compromise the nutritional content and quality of food. Moreover, ozone machines can eliminate bacteria, mold spores, and pesticides from vegetables, fruits, and other foods, thus thus, the health and well-being of consumers are safeguarded. Furthermore, with the elevated living standards, the quality control of products in most restaurants is rigorously monitored by relevant authorities. As a result, it is relatively easy to enjoy a nutritious meal with assured quality without investing excessive time.\nIn conclusion, when all these factors are considered, it becomes evident that there are numerous compelling reasons to endorse my viewpoint.

In reality, an individual without education might not appreciate musicals, while someone with a medical condition due to inadequate healthcare may be unable to engage in sports. Consequently, offering education and healthcare is a more critical and prioritized responsibility for the government.\nEntertainment venues like cinemas, theaters, and sports arenas are primarily driven by profit motives.

Competition among these venues is an inherent aspect of the free market, which should remain free from government intervention. Conversely, the goal of establishing healthcare facilities or educational institutions is to enhance health and educational standards, not to generate profits, thus deserving more government funding.\nMoreover, using taxpayer money for constructing theaters or sports arenas is inequitable to those who cannot benefit from them. For instance, not everyone enjoys attending musicals in person. Hence, it is somewhat unjust to allocate the majority of citizens' tax funds to satisfy the interests of a small group.

Governments should also allocate a portion of their budgets towards air purification, rather than placing the entire burden on corporations and individuals. \nIn summary, considering that governments hold the responsibility of ensuring a clean environment for their citizens and should be accountable for air pollution cleanup, the primary responsibility for air pollution cleanup should lie with both corporations and individuals.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay020", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 172, "to": 300}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 318, "to": 409}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 411, "to": 513}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 528, "to": 647}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 649, "to": 786}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 802, "to": 895}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 897, "to": 1006}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1020, "to": 1082}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1096, "to": 1207}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1233, "to": 1338}], "label": "Claim", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1340, "to": 1495}], "label": "Claim", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1527, "to": 1665}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1667, "to": 1769}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 12}], "edges": [{"source": 4, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]}

Personally, I strongly agree with this notion, and here\u2019s why:\nFirstly, rushing into a decision often means it hasn't been thoroughly analyzed or assessed from multiple perspectives. As a result, swift decisions are more likely to result in unfavorable outcomes. For instance, someone who resigns from their job without carefully planning for alternatives or a backup strategy might find themselves unemployed due to their impulsive choice.\nMoreover, acting on impulse can also lead to missed opportunities. Put simply, if the individual had paused to reflect, they might have discovered a new role within the same organization that suited them better. Therefore, they could have avoided unemployment altogether.\nAdditionally, it is worth noting that rash decisions not only lead to wasted efforts but can also have profound and lasting impacts on a person's life. in other words, after quitting their job, the individual might face financial struggles, unable to cover expenses or afford daily necessities, and consequently, their circumstances would deteriorate significantly.\nFrom this, it becomes evident that decisions made in haste are rarely wise or beneficial.

{"id": "id_796", "input": "Have you ever come across a bear or a monkey in the wild? If so, it was likely in a zoo. Zoos are expansive outdoor areas where various animal species are housed for people to observe, learn about, and admire. Many individuals argue that zoos serve no real purpose or benefit. I wholeheartedly oppose this viewpoint because I contend zoos facilitate social interactions, provide educational opportunities, and foster qualities like respect and understanding for animals.\nTypically, people visit zoos in groups, whether with family or as part of a school outing. At the zoo, they engage with one another, unwind as they observe the animals, play with some, discuss their looks and behaviors, and enjoy their amusing habits. Today, families don't spend as much time together as they did decades ago. A trip to the zoo provides a wonderful opportunity for family bonding, as it's an activity that can be enjoyed by everyone, from young children to elderly grandparents. \nAnimals, their diverse species, habitats, and behaviors are subjects studied in schools and universities. Books and lectures provide knowledge, but an even more effective way to learn comes from visual experiences and firsthand encounters. A zoo visit allows you to observe animals, their habits, dietary preferences, and the unique traits of different species. At the zoo, you can see animals in various forms, such as males versus females or babies compared to adults. It provides a valuable chance to witness their reactions to different scenarios, including weather changes, species and gender interactions, defensive behavior, or caring for their young. Additionally, it can also aid in recognizing which animals might pose a threat. A zoo visit would enhance students' comprehension of what they study in school. \nUltimately, visiting a zoo will cultivate a greater respect and admiration for animals. Appreciation increases when you have seen and understood something firsthand. This is particularly pertinent for city dwellers, whose primary animal interactions are typically with pets like cats and dogs. Currently, there is a noticeable lack of respect for animals. Seeing animals in person and learning about them can heighten awareness of their importance and the respect they warrant.\nThe main reason many people object to zoos is that some zoos do not adequately care for animals, and the facilities they provide are neither clean nor suitable. While this is mostly accurate, it doesn't reflect the overall mission of zoos.

{"id": "id_797", "input": "While renewable energy resources play a role in both current and future energy plans, I believe these cannot quickly take the place of fossil fuels like gas, oil, and coal.\nTo begin with, renewable resources are relatively costly because of technological constraints. Research in renewable energy demands substantial financial investment that developing nations might not manage. Conversely, in many regions, fossil fuels are both plentiful and affordable. For instance, China, believed to have the largest coal deposits globally, is reluctant to heavily invest in costly new energy sources like solar panels and wind installations. Therefore, the transition to renewable energy might be hindered by the financial incapability of some countries to undertake such reforms.\nMoreover, even though energy companies argue that renewable sources are eco-friendly; these alternative energy forms might not be as environmentally benign as perceived. Recent research indicates that renewable energy sources also face issues and could create long-term ecological risks. For example, hydroelectric dams alter river water flow, at times leading to droughts upstream. This adversely affects the ecosystems of crucial fish species and wading birds. Notably, cleaning up heavy metal deposits in river silt behind dams is prohibitively expensive and challenging, leaving future issues. Hence, renewable energy sources might not be as dependable as assumed.\nCertainly, currently, fossil fuels contribute to major environmental issues like acid rain, ozone depletion, and global warming; enhancing mechanism efficiency and cutting emissions can address these issues. For instance, chemicals can be used to remove sulfur from emissions in plants and vehicles, preventing acid rain. these enhancements often prove to be less costly and complex compared to the advanced technology needed for renewable energy.

Some argue that only minor changes occur between generations, while others insist that generational disparities manifest in every aspect. Personally, I hold the view that every perspective between generations evolves, and notably, the challenges faced by this generation differ significantly from those of the previous one.\nFirstly, due to globalization and industrial integration, the work-related difficulties confronting this generation are becoming increasingly complex and demanding. Those who succeed are typically those who can swiftly adapt to this rapidly evolving world. In earlier times, mastering a single skill sufficed to tackle problems, given that industries were relatively small and straightforward to handle. Nonetheless, as these industries grow and reach a global scale, individuals must possess multiple skills to meet these challenges. For instance, there is now greater opportunity to conduct business internationally, meaning alongside professional expertise, language proficiency is crucial. Another illustration is financial crimes are prevalent in the 21st century, leading to creating a demand for individuals skilled in both legal and financial disciplines.\nSecondly, this generation faces a self-discovery challenge that previous generations did not experience. The prior generation had less autonomy and was often expected to follow predetermined paths set by their parents. On the other hand, today's youth are exposed to a greater array of creative ideas and tend to think independently. They are keen to understand their identity and desires. It is a privilege for them to grapple with these pleasant dilemmas, yet these concerns are by no means simple to resolve. They must choose among numerous possibilities and bear the consequences of their choices.\nIn summary, challenges for the current generation are more intricate and varied than those faced by the preceding generation, both in professional and personal identity realms.

Two primary methods of gaining life insights are heeding the advice of family and friends and learning through firsthand experiences. Both approaches are worthwhile as they offer unique benefits.\nOn one hand, learning about life by listening to advice from family and friends is more pragmatic than the latter approach. Family members, such as parents, possess life experience, allowing them to provide you with genuine and appropriate guidance on various aspects of life. Friends, who belong to your generation, understand your preferences and capabilities well enough to advise on what suits you and what doesn't.

At a youthful age, individuals are less likely to secure high-paying employment, hence Covering costs for rent, food, utilities, and other necessities to support oneself can be challenging. Consequently, I assert that staying with parents is a sensible decision for adults until they establish their career with a stable income.\nAn additional benefit of remaining with parents longer is the strengthened emotional bond. Parents offer valuable guidance to their offspring as they navigate the transitions of adult life. Co-habiting fosters an atmosphere conducive to discussing the physiological and psychological transformations adults experience directly with their parents.

Undoubtedly, children are nurtured by two pivotal figures: their parents and teachers, both playing crucial roles in their growth. From my perspective, I support the notion that teachers are the superior choice for children's education in certain respects. \nFirstly, educators at schools possess higher qualifications in educational domains compared to parents. For example, achieving teaching certification demands years of academic training where individuals acquire theoretical knowledge.

While some argue that the government should intervene in this inequitable situation, there are those who disagree with this perspective. I concur that in this scenario, it is not the government's role to intervene.\nSkillfulness leads to perfection in artistic endeavors. It is evident that contemporary artists who channel their innovative ideas into high-value creations are compensated generously by art collectors. Furthermore, the substantial earnings of modern artists are attributed to quality over quantity and their unique abilities. For instance, a handcrafted 15 centimeter Buddha statue is valued multiple times higher than mass-produced versions. Conversely, modern artists dedicate themselves to discovering unique concepts that ordinary individuals cannot, turning the impossible into possible. Pieter Padang, the creator of Minions, ingeniously transformed a lyric in the song \"I Swear\" to \"underwear\" for the Minions' performance in Despicable Me. He was rewarded with significant financial compensation for this idea.\nIn stark contrast, workers in merchandise factories earn mere dollars despite producing hundreds of 15 cm Buddha statues daily. In any event, a musician performing \"I Swear\" repeatedly earns differently compared to Padang because the musician simply replays the song without any creative input. Moreover, the government cannot standardize the pricing of modern artists' creations because there is no definitive metric to assess its value, art valuation is subjective and based on individual taste.\nNonetheless, the substantial earnings of modern artists are linked to their dedication to art, though what constitutes 'dedication' may differ across professions.

For example, there are numerous gaming apps online, many of which are quite violent. In these games, children are incentivized to assist their characters in killing or shooting monsters or other players' characters, potentially fostering aggressive feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. Thus, frequent disagreements may arise during interactions.\nOn the other hand, this matter can be viewed from different angles. Mobile phones, like smartphones, have made communication straightforward and convenient. The reason for this is that since most telecom companies offer internet access through our phones, people can enjoy sending instant messages and making international calls without charge. Hence, mobile phones have bridged the gap in communication. \nIn conclusion, while mobile phones accelerate our communication, they also contribute to several social issues, such as affecting children's social skills and mental well-being.

Therefore, this example clearly illustrates the connection between machine usage and negative health outcomes.\nConversely, there are those who assert that machines simplify tasks and reduce the time required to complete the same amount of work. consider the example of food processors in kitchens. chopping, blending, grating, and kneading have become so effortless that people can't imagine life without this basic appliance at home. Consequently, it is clear that machines make everyday tasks quicker and less burdensome.\nUpon evaluating these viewpoints, it is concluded that the use of machines is beneficial since machines facilitate ease and efficiency in work. the health drawbacks can be overlooked due to there are numerous alternative ways to exercise and maintain health. Consequently, it is anticipated that in the future, people will embrace the use of more machines while finding new ways to maintain their health.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay363", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 412, "to": 465}], "label": "Claim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 474, "to": 528}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 544, "to": 594}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 596, "to": 676}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 678, "to": 765}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 778, "to": 876}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 922, "to": 1010}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1012, "to": 1063}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1065, "to": 1200}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1233, "to": 1289}], "label": "Claim", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1346, "to": 1379}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1386, "to": 1433}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1435, "to": 1473}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1481, "to": 1548}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}], "edges": [{"source": 0, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 0, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 0, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 0, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 0, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 9, 10, 11, 12]}

However, some countries have more lenient gun control measures compared to others, making this a contentious issue globally. In my opinion, implementing stringent gun control is a prudent decision.\nThe primary concern is the potential for gun-related mishaps. Despite the restriction that only licensed individuals can purchase firearms, accidents are not entirely preventable. For instance, we occasionally hear reports of accidental injuries during hunting activities. Thus, reducing the number of guns in circulation would lead to fewer accidents, enhancing safety and lowering accident rates in our environment.\nMoreover, a significant portion of violent crimes are connected to gun misuse, especially in countries where firearms are readily accessible. Ultimately, the ongoing trend could foster a more violent society. As an illustration, in the United States, young adults and even minors have access to firearms, resulting in tragic school shootings. Even more concerning, some terrorists can acquire weapons that are more advanced than those available to law enforcement, putting citizens in constant jeopardy.\nFurthermore, having access to guns can also increase the likelihood of suicide. In America, firearms are the most frequently used method of suicide, responsible for approximately half of all cases. Sadly, there is a growing trend of suicides among teenagers as well as individuals aged 75 and older.\nTo sum up, taking into account the escalating rates of accidents, violent crimes, and suicides, I advocate that firearms should be strictly regulated, with the government implementing comprehensive laws to protect society from violence.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay036", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 257, "to": 313}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 377, "to": 493}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 509, "to": 586}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 594, "to": 731}], "label": "Claim", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 743, "to": 873}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 887, "to": 940}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 962, "to": 1074}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1098, "to": 1235}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1250, "to": 1315}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1317, "to": 1433}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1442, "to": 1535}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1548, "to": 1631}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1649, "to": 1772}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 12}], "edges": [{"source": 3, "target": 1, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 3, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 3, 4, 8, 11, 12]}

Many believe that alternative resources like nuclear and solar power, which are abundant and environmentally friendly, can meet this demand. In this essay, I will delve into these possibilities.\nFirstly, water remains the predominant energy source today. Even though despite significant water shortages, many nations continue to depend solely on it for electricity generation. the essential resources needed to produce such a large amount of energy are becoming scarce. Consequently, developing countries like India experience frequent power outages during the summer months. if the government promotes nuclear, solar, or wind energy, there might be fewer issues in supplying the necessary electricity. Hence, utilizing other available energy sources for electricity generation would be a prudent government initiative.\nSecondly, most of the currently used power sources emit large quantities of gases into the atmosphere, exacerbating global warming. For instance, using a solar cooker instead of an electric one could significantly decrease the effects of global warming. Similarly, nuclear energy, when used in place of hydro-kinetic energy, results in less atmospheric pollution.\nIn conclusion, encouraging the adoption of alternative energy sources would be a more effective governmental strategy.

In recent years, however, there has been a noticeable rise in the number of individuals adopting vegetarianism. Some assert that this shift is due to concern for animal rights, while others believe the reasons extend beyond that. It is apparent to me that individuals abstain from consuming meat primarily for health and religious reasons.\nFirstly, the pursuit of better health is the primary driver behind the growing popularity of vegetarian diets. Numerous studies have demonstrated that various vegetables are rich in antioxidants, which may help prevent cancer. This underscores the fact that a diet centered around vegetables can be beneficial for our well-being. Although there are those who contend that eliminating meat from one's diet might result in insufficient protein consumption, it has been established that legumes such as soybeans and peas provide comparable protein levels.\nSecondly, religious convictions also steer people towards a vegetarian lifestyle. Certain religions, like Buddhism, uphold the belief that animals were once human beings in past lives, so consuming their meat equates to eating the flesh of one's ancestors. Critics often argue that this perspective lacks scientific grounding. Nevertheless, I firmly believe that adhering to one's religious beliefs is essential as it can lead to spiritual enlightenment.\nIn conclusion, it is clear to me that individuals opt for vegetarianism due to health and spiritual reasons, rather than solely for animal welfare.

While many smokers argue that smoking helps them work more efficiently or fosters creativity, these arguments do not validate any health benefits of smoking. I believe that smoking should be prohibited, particularly in public venues like restaurants because it causes discomfort for non-smokers due to poor air quality.\nTo begin with, restaurants are venues where individuals pay to relish their meals. Smoking in dining areas undeniably disrupts others from enjoying their food. Eating while surrounded by smoke makes it difficult for patrons to savor their meals. \nMoreover, restaurants are commonly visited by families. This indicates that children, elderly individuals, and pregnant women are often present in restaurants. Smoking in restaurants sets a poor example for children. Children are highly likely to mimic adult behavior because they possess a significant curiosity towards new things. Smoking in restaurants may also harm the health of older adults, especially those with cardiac or respiratory issues. Pregnant women are among the most vulnerable to the dangers of smoke exposure as inhaling polluted air can hinder fetal development.\nFinally, secondhand smokers face numerous health hazards. When near smokers, they breathe in toxic fumes. Passive smokers are prone to ailments such as strokes, heart problems, hearing impairment, and cancers. From my perspective, passive smokers are treated unfairly since despite not smoking, they endure similar health risks as smokers.\nIn summary, smoking should be banned in dining establishments as many individuals would suffer adverse effects.

Serious films are typically crafted to convey reflections on love and humanity; furthermore, they may also shed light on societal issues.\nSecondly, not every serious film is dull. \"Click\" is an intriguing comedy that seriously explores the necessity of maintaining a work-life balance. The film uses humor and satire to provoke thoughts about life's true value, reminding us of our family's significance. Consequently, serious films often contain implicit messages beyond mere visuals and dialogue, prompting self-reflection.\nAdditionally, some serious films aim to make us contemplate the world's darker aspects. \"Blood Diamond,\" based on true events in South Africa, highlights the connection between diamonds and conflict. Viewing the film may impart a lesson about the relationship between jewels and mortality. Diamonds are neither rare nor symbols of true love; they are, in fact, emblematic of harsh realities.

From my point of view, these beliefs are not only traditional but also outdated. I lean towards the contrary view that businesses should refrain from employing workers for their entire careers due to three significant reasons. \nTo begin with, fresh ideas and creativity from various individuals are essential for a company to prosper. The invaluable experience of seasoned employees can be transmitted to young apprentices who adapt to new roles yet frequently contribute innovative ideas. Additionally, the swift advancement across all sectors today necessitates precise updates and access to contemporary knowledge. Thus, young individuals are adept at fulfilling these criteria. Furthermore, they possess dynamism, creativity, and initiative, allowing them to excel in their tasks. These crucial aspects determine whether a company can succeed or not.\nSecondly, employees often grow weary of their stable job over an extended period. At some point, they might believe that a secure job is paramount because they must earn a living to sustain themselves. Subsequently, many eventually recognize that career advancement and competition can help enhance their skills and broaden their perspectives as well. Numerous individuals relish challenging themselves because they do not wish to become stagnant and inactive. A monotonous environment quickly leads to their demoralization, hence this scenario negatively affects the company. \nFinally, economic downturns and financial crises cause a significant surge in unemployment. In my view, companies should hire a variety of workers to address this pressing issue. It helps jobless individuals improve their livelihoods. Moreover, factories and companies will have ample workforce to maintain production rates and generate innovative ideas. \nIn summary, the diverse attributes of different individuals, the fatigue from consistently holding the same job, and addressing unemployment issues lead me to concur with the notion that employers should avoid hiring staff for their entire careers.

{"id": "id_824", "input": "Technology propels the pace of human evolution forward. With cutting-edge advancements, numerous feats once deemed unattainable have now been realized. For instance, people of the past never envisioned being able to communicate instantly with anyone or see someone from across the globe on a computer display, both achievable through mobile phones and the internet. Nonetheless, some argue that technology has diminished children's creativity. I acknowledge that technology might have some adverse impacts on children, yet I believe technology enhances children's creative abilities.\nFirstly, technology motivates children to invent new things. Children are inherently curious about their surroundings, hence when they encounter a sophisticated gadget like a smartphone, they become fascinated by its enigmatic features and eager to understand its operation. For instance, Bill Gates was intrigued by the original massive computer, prompting him to learn everything about its functionality. Once he comprehended the details, he began advocating for computers. Ultimately, he successfully created a user-friendly and portable computer. Consequently, rather than stifling children's imagination, technology actually fosters their learning and inventive processes.\nSecondly, technology broadens children's horizons. Historically, children could only view situations from a single angle. However, with advanced technology, children can access information from other countries and interact with international peers. Thus, they have the opportunity to learn about various cultures and different mindsets. Knowledge forms the foundation of creativity. The varied knowledge children acquire globally sparks their creativity and motivates them to innovate.\nCertainly, technology might exert negative influences on children.

Furthermore, this harmful habit poses significant health risks to non-smokers who are exposed to secondhand smoke. Consequently, it is contended that smoking should be outlawed in public venues such as bus and train stations. This stance will be substantiated by examining the advantages this measure has brought to both the general populace and smokers themselves.\nTo begin with, the non-smoking population would undeniably gain from the imposition of such a restriction. Before the 1980s, public spaces in Sri Lanka illustrated a distressing scenario where individuals smoked without restraint. They would even smoke on public transportation, sometimes leading to aggressive confrontations. Once limitations were imposed, the situation became manageable, providing a clear advantage to society.\nMoreover, implementing a smoking prohibition in public areas would significantly deter individuals from indulging in tobacco use. For example, the further imposition of smoking bans in Sri Lanka's capital has led to a decrease in tobacco-related diseases and fatalities, according to the health ministry. As this indicates, smoking restrictions have effectively discouraged the public from engaging in this harmful habit, thereby easing the burden on the country's healthcare systems.\nBy evaluating the prohibition of smoking in public spaces in Sri Lanka, it has been demonstrated that people derive benefits from this policy.

Young students need to learn about balanced diets, nutritious foods, as well as those that can be harmful, which helps they will gain a basic understanding of maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Furthermore, it's considerably easier for young individuals to develop habits, such as avoiding excessive consumption of fast foods, overly fried items, or intoxicants.\nMoreover, this approach can economically benefit by preventing certain diseases. It's important to highlight that diseases like cancer or HIV, which cannot be prevented, can cost a patient a fortune, not necessarily for a cure, but merely to extend life by a few years. Likewise, if people maintain regular fitness through outdoor activities or health products, conditions like obesity, myopia, and other costly diseases will be significantly reduced.\nIn conclusion, I must acknowledge the shift from focusing on treatments to emphasizing health education and preventative strategies.

{"id": "id_830", "input": "There is an ongoing debate about whether achieving success typically involves taking risks or trying new things, and the issue can be viewed from multiple perspectives due to its complexity. Some individuals lean towards the idea that success comes from venturing into the unknown, while others hold the opposite view. After careful consideration, I have formed my own opinion. I lean towards the latter; that is, successful individuals continue doing what they are familiar with.\nThe primary reason for this belief stems from the undeniable fact that to achieve success, we all strive to minimize the risks we might face. The fewer the factors that could lead to failure, the greater the likelihood of success. Consider a scenario where someone is wealthy because they possess extensive knowledge of investments. They can concentrate on specific companies they deem worthy of investment and then simply wait for steady, albeit moderate, returns. They do not need to invest in high-risk companies for higher profits, which could quickly lead to bankruptcy. Consequently, we can begin to accept that successful individuals do not need to embrace new ventures or take risks.\nFurthermore, another important factor is that it hinges on one's ability to determine whether they can succeed. At the very least, a successful person should be able to overcome obstacles that hinder their success. For example, sports stars do not need to resort to drugs to win games or showcase their exceptional skills. The reason for their success is that they possess superior abilities in the sports domain. On the other hand, those athletes who attempt to stand out by taking the risk of using drugs fail to achieve success. Thus, from this scenario, we can assert that taking risks is not essential for successful individuals.\nAdmittedly, there are some who argue that trying something new is vital for people to succeed because it allows them to differentiate themselves from others, which is also a commonly accepted notion of success. However, in my limited view, I question the reliability of that assertion due to its recklessness. Trying something new can indeed make individuals stand out, yet it does not necessarily equate to being successful.\nConsidering the reasons outlined above, I am convinced that continuing with what we already know can still lead to success because the benefits of this approach are significantly greater than the alternative. In other words, minimizing risks and enhancing individual abilities is the key route to success. This is not to say, of course, that other perspectives lack merit.

{"id": "id_831", "input": "While distance learning offers numerous benefits, it should not take the place of traditional classroom education. Classroom learning offers more comprehensive information. Furthermore, classroom education involves not just academic skills but also social skills and problem-solving in real-life situations. Therefore, I strongly oppose the idea that online courses should replace conventional courses. I will present reasons to support my viewpoint.\nTo start with, classroom education can enrich students' understanding and knowledge of their subjects. This is because classrooms are equipped with various tools for demonstrating real-world examples. For instance, in biology lessons, dissecting frogs provides numerous advantages. Students learn to handle tools and observe the actual organs of a frog. In contrast to virtual classes, online classes focus solely on textbook learning rather than real-world experiences.\nIn addition, virtual classes fail to impart social skills. For example, Within a classroom, teachers can assign group tasks to students. This helps students learn to interact and collaborate effectively within a group. Such essential skills are not available in online courses.\nFinally, students tend to lead healthier lifestyles with classroom education because schools offer physical education classes that encourage physical activity. Professional trainers in classrooms guide students to exercise correctly. Students risk injury if they attempt exercises on their own. This contributes to a healthier lifestyle, which online classes cannot offer.\nTo sum up, I personally reject the notion of replacing physical classrooms with virtual classes.

The debate over teaching financial management to young students is ongoing. Some believe that imparting money management skills to teenagers will help them grasp the significance of money, while others worry that introducing children to financial matters at this age could have adverse effects. Personally, I concur with the notion that high school students should be educated about financial management.\nThe reason I advocate for adolescents need to grasp the basics of managing money is mainly when teenagers reach the stage of pursuing higher education, they often live in dorms or with peers, away from family; learning money management early on instills a greater sense of responsibility and confidence. For instance, as a child, my father kept a monthly expense log, and I was encouraged to do the same with my pocket money, which became a habit that aided me in budgeting later in life.\nMoreover, early financial education enhances students' understanding of their family's economic situation, reducing unrealistic desires. Consider, for example, purchasing a gaming console might be insignificant for a student from a wealthy background. On the other hand, for a middle-class student, buying a gaming console might not be a priority. Therefore, exposure to financial management during high school aids in effectively prioritizing financial obligations.\nIn conclusion, I assert that students who learn money management techniques tend to experience more benefits than drawbacks.

Consequently, some companies have banned smoking on their premises, and various governments have imposed restrictions on smoking in public spaces. It is widely acknowledged that this initiative will bring substantial benefits, enhancing both the health standards and the international image of a country over time.\nTo begin with, it is universally recognized and scientifically confirmed that smoking poses severe risks to smokers and to others who have been exposed to smoke for prolonged periods. Recent mortality data from the Malaysian Ministry of Health indicate that the leading cause of death was lung-related illnesses attributed to smoking. A significant number of these deaths involved non-smokers, especially young children and pregnant women, who are susceptible to these dangerous diseases. Hence, the rate of fatalities could be considerably lowered with the enforcement of a complete ban on smoking in public areas.\nMoreover, a nation can foster a healthy image by imposing strict penalties on public smoking violators. For example, the government of Brunei recently enacted a law prohibiting smoking in public places such as cafes, hospitals, and shopping streets. This measure has reduced the number of smokers in the country, thereby maintaining Brunei's reputation for peacefulness and cleanliness. This case exemplifies how restricting public smoking can benefit a nation overall.\nIn conclusion, efforts to ban smoking in public areas are effectively mitigating related health risks and fostering the development of a healthier nation.

Some argue that integrating advanced plant foods with cutting-edge equipment greatly cuts down the expenses of farm product production, while others contend that this combination has numerous adverse effects on human health and society.\nAdmittedly, the use of advanced fertilizers alongside automated harvesting tools boosts farmers' economic gains. This stems from the fact that synthetic fertilizers enhance the productivity of each square inch of farmland to produce more crops, and automatic machinery boosts harvest efficiency. As a result, the cost of producing and labor for each kilogram of agricultural products has significantly dropped.\nHowever, high-tech fertilizers could potentially endanger people's health. Unlike organic plant foods, industrial fertilizers consist of uncommon chemicals that not only alter the genetic makeup of crops but also remain within the plants indefinitely. Under these circumstances, people who regularly consume these fertilized products might face various health issues later on.\nIn addition, over-dependence on electronic harvesting equipment has multiple societal impacts. One impact is the exacerbation of air pollution due to excessive exhaust emissions. Conversely, manual harvesting helps avoid severe environmental harm. Furthermore, mechanized reaping leads to higher unemployment in the agricultural sector, likely because high-tech harvesting machinery replaces a large workforce in the fields.\nIn conclusion, even though newly developed plant foods and machinery have brought significant economic success to farmers, it is persuasive that the drawbacks of employing these innovations in agriculture cannot be ignored.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay115", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 330, "to": 429}], "label": "Premise", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 461, "to": 612}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 627, "to": 727}], "label": "Claim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 738, "to": 802}], "label": "Claim", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 804, "to": 979}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1008, "to": 1104}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1119, "to": 1199}], "label": "Claim", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1201, "to": 1283}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1297, "to": 1352}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1367, "to": 1441}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1458, "to": 1529}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1558, "to": 1652}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1676, "to": 1753}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 12}], "edges": [{"source": 0, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 0, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [2, 3, 6, 11, 12]}

Typically, the latter group finds it challenging to allocate time for physical exercise. It's widely recognized that engaging in at least 30 minutes of exercise is foundational to leading a healthy and joyful life. However, I don't believe that an equal financial allocation should be made between academic resources like libraries and labs and physical or social activities.\nFirstly, from my perspective, investing heavily in gym facilities or constructing sports courts is not essential to motivate students to engage in physical activities. For instance, my roommate, Mary, consistently wakes up at 6 a.m. and dedicates an hour to exercise in the park near our dormitory. Upon returning to the dorm, she is brimming with energy, and after a shower, she is ready to embark on a productive day. As demonstrated, she is able to exercise without incurring any expense. The university should focus on educating students about the advantages of physical activity by displaying posters on campus, inviting athletes to give talks, and encouraging students to prioritize their health and fitness.\nMoreover, students select their field of study based on their personal interests. The university must ensure that physical education students have access to top-notch equipment. This is because their chosen field is entirely centered around physical activity. Conversely, for students pursuing engineering or medicine, prioritizing gym facilities over laboratory resources seems unjust, as it significantly boosts students' motivation to utilize cutting-edge technology for learning and potentially discovering new insights in their discipline.\nLastly, allocating funds to social activities appears to be a wasteful expenditure. Students who wish to socialize or meet new people typically do not consider university events as their first choice. For example, when my friends and I decide to spend time together, we prefer going outside the university to places where we won't be interrupted by familiar faces.\nIn summary, I acknowledge the role of sports in contributing to university students' success, yet I firmly believe sports and social activities should not receive the same funding as libraries and laboratories.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay268", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 398, "to": 548}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 580, "to": 716}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 732, "to": 847}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 849, "to": 968}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 987, "to": 1040}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1042, "to": 1263}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1275, "to": 1345}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1347, "to": 1441}], "label": "Claim", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1459, "to": 1523}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1537, "to": 1650}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1655, "to": 1808}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1818, "to": 1892}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1894, "to": 2009}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2024, "to": 2173}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2187, "to": 2267}], "label": "Claim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2290, "to": 2384}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 15}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 7, 11, 14, 15]}
{"id": "id_840", "input": "Libraries and sports activities significantly contribute to the success of universities. Most university rankings consider the quality of these two elements. From my perspective, universities should prioritize investments in libraries over other areas.\nTo begin with, I believe that libraries are a crucial and strategic component of a university. It is essential for both professors and students to have access to a modern, well-equipped library because beyond the internet, libraries are pivotal in research. Although sports are important, they do not hold the same level of priority as libraries. Additionally, only a small portion of students participate in sports activities. For instance, at my university, the number of students using the library far exceeds those engaged in sports.\nSecondly, libraries typically do not generate income. most libraries are free not only for students but also for the public. Therefore, support from universities is crucial for the sustainability of libraries. Yet, sports activities can generate substantial income as each sport features various matches, attracting numerous sponsors. Furthermore, they have the opportunity to sell tickets for major matches. In conclusion, while sports activities have several ways to cover their expenses, it is challenging for libraries to secure a steady income stream.\nMoreover, investing in libraries yields long-term benefits. For example, a library can acquire a large number of new books or more computers. the majority of library resources are durable and can be utilized over an extended period. Furthermore, in the long run, they gain more value. Conversely, most sports facilities, aside from buildings, have a limited lifespan and are not long-lasting.\nDespite the significance of sports activities, libraries hold greater importance.

{"id": "id_842", "input": "When students finish high school and need to choose where to live next, they often grapple with deciding between two main options: residing in an apartment or staying in university dormitories. In my view, each option comes with its own set of pros and cons. \nOn one side, staying in a dormitory allows students to become accustomed to the university's academic atmosphere. For example, students have the opportunity to engage in various extracurricular activities on campus, such as participating in conversation clubs or joining sports teams. They also have increased opportunities to interact with their instructors and peers. Moreover, getting assistance becomes more straightforward for students, for instance, if they encounter difficulties with math problems, they can easily seek help from roommates, classmates, or instructors. I believe that residing in a dormitory is consistently beneficial for students. \nConversely, living off-campus equips students for real-world experiences. For instance, students can acquire important life skills such as responsibility, independence, punctuality, and cooperation, more so than in university dorms. They must manage all aspects of their living situation, including paying rent promptly and handling utility bills. Additionally, students also need to remain focused on their studies and strive to maintain high grades. Furthermore, students have the chance to learn about the surrounding community. Engaging with local people and socializing with them helps prepare students for post-graduate life. \nGiven the evidence, it appears challenging for students to decide on their living arrangements since both types of living accommodations offer distinct advantages.

Given the brevity of life, it's unwise to experiment without preparation; hence, we should learn from others' errors so that we can steer clear of repeating them.

{"id": "id_844", "input": "Beginning in the late 1700s, industrialization and urbanization led to a surge in the number of automobiles. The oil they depend on has now become the main pollutant in urban environments. Although some critics condemn the excessive consumption of oil and others propose that drivers should pay additional fees during peak hours for their self-centered actions, I argue that drivers should not be required to pay extra charges. Here are the reasons supporting this view. \nCapitalism has empowered individuals with the right to own property, and by extension, the right to utilize it. Driving vehicles during peak hours may contribute to urban pollution, but legal protections exist for drivers to do so, and therefore, imposing additional fees might seem beyond legal authority. From an alternative perspective, traffic congestion is an inevitable occurrence that cannot be entirely avoided or prohibited; thus it lies beyond the control of drivers. Why impose a penalty on drivers simply for using their own vehicles at certain times? Wars are infamous, yet the soldiers who fight for their nations are not to blame.\nPurchasing a car costs hundreds of thousands; covering various fees demands even more\u2014this is already a significant financial strain for most families. Adding another fee for drivers is senseless and absurd. Most families purchase cars primarily for safer and more convenient transportation, and imposing excessive fees greatly increases their financial burden and undermines their rights.\nInstead of passively compelling drivers to pay additional charges, the government should proactively advocate for the adoption of more efficient and eco-friendly energy sources or develop more sensible and convenient infrastructure to facilitate travel with less reliance on oil. Traffic congestion sometimes arises merely from a malfunctioning traffic signal or poorly organized roadways. In such situations, it is the city planner who should be held accountable, not the drivers. Put simply, imposing fees on drivers without considering the actual causes of the issues could be absurd and potentially illegal. \nIn summary, peak traffic times are not typically the direct fault of drivers.

Some individuals believe it's an acceptable sacrifice in the era of globalization, whereas others contend that the drawbacks surpass the advantages. Personally, I side with the former view.\nThe vast advantages of English being globally embraced are undeniable. Firstly, it simplifies interaction between various nations and cultures. In my nation, English is a mandatory subject starting from primary school. Consequently, pursuing education overseas becomes easier and increasingly popular among the youth. For these individuals, language barriers no longer pose an issue, fostering mutual comprehension and trust between one's homeland and the host nation. This, in turn, strengthens relationships and boosts international trade. Additionally, scientists, particularly in high technology fields, can access a broader spectrum of resources if proficient in English. Consider the IT sector, where cutting-edge scientific information is released in English. It's impractical to obtain a translated version of these documents or rely constantly on an interpreter. Therefore, they are compelled to adopt English as a secondary language.\nUnderstandably, critics may argue that English is causing the disappearance of lesser-known languages annually. As a result, national identity and cultural heritage fade away.

{"id": "id_846", "input": "As the wheels of modern society spin ever faster, life becomes increasingly intricate and challenging compared to the past. Thus, it's crucial for individuals, especially the youth, to develop planning and organizational skills because it enhances efficiency and mitigates the risk of crises in our actions. Concurrently, removing pointless actions.\nTo begin with, excellent planning and organizational skills can make our actions more efficient and productive. Consider my own experience: I used to feel swamped by the tasks of preparing for final exams, submitting papers, and completing internship work at the end of each term. However, this year, following my roommate John's advice, I created a to-do list to meticulously plan and organize everything I needed to accomplish for finals, thereby managing tasks and minor details effectively. This planning skill has greatly assisted me, enabling me to reach the top rank in my class while completing all other tasks.\nSimilarly, the ability to plan and organize also aids young individuals in averting crises in their actions, which could potentially negate years of effort. As is well known, employees in any company must generate as much profit as possible for their supervisors and execute their duties flawlessly. If some employees lack foresight in planning and organizing, they might procrastinate and only act when deadlines loom. However, circumstances are constantly evolving. For example, the company's schedule changes, moving task deadlines to earlier dates. Under such circumstances, employees who failed to plan and complete their work ahead of time might not meet deadlines, risking penalties or dismissal. No employee can afford such a setback.\nUltimately, some argue that planning and organizational skills can be acquired once one secures a job. Hence, young people do not necessarily need to possess these skills. Nonetheless, this skill is equally vital for young individuals because young people can overcome bad habits and achieve their objectives faster with this skill. While searching for information online, young people might be distracted by attractions like online games or social networks. In this scenario, they could spend hours aimlessly browsing the internet. This clearly results in a significant waste of time. But however, if they plan first and adhere to their plans, they could accomplish their tasks more swiftly than expected.\nIn today's intricate society, we, as young people, are surrounded by numerous tasks, therefore planning and organizational skills are undeniably potent tools that we must equip ourselves with.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay270", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 130, "to": 227}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 236, "to": 306}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 365, "to": 460}], "label": "Claim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 462, "to": 629}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 631, "to": 843}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 845, "to": 968}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 981, "to": 1125}], "label": "Claim", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1145, "to": 1268}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1270, "to": 1388}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1451, "to": 1521}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1549, "to": 1672}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1674, "to": 1711}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1741, "to": 1814}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1823, "to": 1883}], "label": "Claim", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1898, "to": 1947}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1956, "to": 2044}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2046, "to": 2170}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2190, "to": 2244}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2246, "to": 2297}], "label": "Premise", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2303, "to": 2418}], "label": "Premise", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2420, "to": 2503}], "label": "Claim", "id": 20}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2515, "to": 2611}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 21}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 13, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 13, "target": 14, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 13, "target": 19, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 14, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 19, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 19, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 19, "target": 18, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 6, 13, 20, 21]}

Furthermore, Moreover, people gain the desired flexibility in their working hours. Studying from home also presents an appealing choice for students.

Once implemented, it will offer numerous advantages to both the public and the authorities.\nHealth education leads to enduring positive impacts on future generations. To begin with, thanks to comprehensive health education from a young age, children will develop good health habits that they may maintain into adolescence. For instance, if a child learns to live a hygienic lifestyle early on, they are likely to continue this habit as they grow older. Furthermore, health education equips individuals, particularly children, with essential knowledge to defend against disease risks. Instead of fear or panic, they might respond more calmly if they unfortunately contract common illnesses like allergies or seasonal sicknesses. Many illnesses that are easily treatable can become severe without proper treatment. Health education enables individuals to make informed treatment decisions, leading to quicker recovery.\nPreventive measures contribute to the improvement of the overall health condition of all citizens. For example, vaccinations ensure that pregnant women and their babies are safeguarded from serious infectious diseases like flu, smallpox, rubella, among others. When large-scale vaccination campaigns are conducted nationwide, the overall health of the community significantly improves. As human resources are crucial to a country's development, allocating funds to improve the general health condition is unquestionably the right choice. Moreover, since the expenses associated with treatment typically exceed those of prevention, the government can conserve substantial amounts in the national health budget.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that we should prioritize health education and preventive measures over treatment.

A contributing factor to good health is the favorable weather and smaller population found in small towns. Additionally, Small towns experience less congestion and reduced traffic. Living in areas with minimal air and noise pollution promotes better health, leading to reduced stress and increased happiness. Furthermore, Foods and materials tend to be healthier in small towns compared to large cities, with access to fresh produce. Despite a few exceptions, It's evident that residing in small towns is healthier than in large urban centers.\nSecondly, A further benefit of small-town living is the reduced cost of living. The cost of living is a major concern for everyone, and it's generally lower in small towns than in big cities. Consequently, In small towns, one can enjoy spacious homes with beautiful views, and Due to less crowded conditions, there are more facilities and services available. Transportation expenses are lower compared to big cities, with less traffic congestion, allowing This helps save both time and money.\nIn summary, I opt for living in a small town, and I believe It provides perks like reduced stress due to improved weather conditions and stronger community relationships.

{"id": "id_853", "input": "In my family, the recurring debate between my father and mother centers around my father's career. Five years ago, he left his two-decade-long career as an architectural engineer to pursue landscape painting. Whenever I inquire about his decision, he earnestly responds, \"I was tired of doing the same thing for 20 years and just wanted to try something different.\" Although many might find this decision absurd, arguing that repetition is the essence of a job, I find myself supporting my father's view.\nMany employees have grown accustomed to repetitive tasks. It empowers us to accomplish more. My mother has spent 25 years as a leading dentist in our province. Gandhi dedicated his entire life to opposing British rule and inspiring civil rights movements in India, ultimately becoming the nation's father. These instances clearly show that significant accomplishments require someone dedicated to a single task over a long period. While when discussing \"happiness,\" diverse job types can be a contributing factor.\nEngaging in various tasks makes both employees and employers considerably more content. Workers in typical companies or industries may find monotonous tasks tiresome over time. Even though they may become well-versed in their roles, switching jobs contributes to their happiness. Switching job types can be invigorating and helps employees adapt to new settings, which, as psychological theories suggest, leads to greater relaxation and happiness. For instance, considering all workers have the capability to perform various kinds of work, employers will appreciate the resultant benefits. Both will find happiness because it's the job change, not repetitive daily tasks.\nDiverse tasks throughout the workday present more challenges, adding vibrancy to life. Much like a song, without challenges, life would lack excitement. As an engineering researcher, I may feel disappointed by setbacks but thrilled by new challenges. New challenges from varied tasks bring not just more work, but also more opportunities to gain knowledge and experience. As expressed by a Chinese writer, life's vibrancy isn't found in cherry blossoms or maple leaves, but in the constant presence of new experiences and challenges. Ultimately, repeating the same tasks continuously only adds to our mental stress; engaging with diverse job types can enrich our lives.\nIn conclusion, I respect my father's decision, and while repetition allows us to become experts, like my mother, I firmly believe that diverse tasks bring more vibrancy to our lives.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay324", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 563, "to": 596}], "label": "Premise", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 598, "to": 663}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 665, "to": 809}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 845, "to": 934}], "label": "Claim", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 942, "to": 1017}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1019, "to": 1105}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1107, "to": 1194}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1208, "to": 1250}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1252, "to": 1297}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1299, "to": 1465}], "label": "Claim", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1481, "to": 1607}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1609, "to": 1633}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1642, "to": 1689}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1691, "to": 1776}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1778, "to": 1842}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1844, "to": 1940}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1942, "to": 2061}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2063, "to": 2223}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2237, "to": 2359}], "label": "Claim", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2418, "to": 2456}], "label": "Claim", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2496, "to": 2542}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 20}], "edges": [{"source": 3, "target": 0, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 4, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 9, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 7, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 9, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [3, 9, 18, 19, 20]}

To begin with, similar to humans, animals are born into this world with innate instincts. These instincts are crucial for their survival in their natural habitats.

Mobile phones are no exception. Talking loudly on the phone in public spaces like schools, libraries, and hospitals is often considered rude and disruptive. Even more concerning, some students employ their mobile phones as a tool for cheating during exams, exchanging answers via text messages.

There is widespread concern about conversations being intercepted by third parties. This risk is ever-present. However, a more secure and dependable system could be developed to protect users' private information.\nAdditionally, mobile phones have become indispensable multifunctional devices in daily life.

When compared to other pastimes such as attending the theater or sports events, watching TV is an economical hobby that provides viewers with numerous indirect experiences.

Individuals who have favorite shows often become engrossed in them when they are broadcast. Consequently, they are unable to schedule outings or gatherings with family or friends during those times since they perceive these shows as essential to their lives.

This situation impacts not only basketball but also our friendship, which thrives on regular meetings and conversations. In other words, by staying home alone to watch TV, my friend missed the chance to strengthen our bond.\nFurthermore, even when people watch TV together, it doesn't facilitate conversation. Watching TV with others isn't much different from watching it alone. Therefore, watching TV isn't beneficial for those wishing to enhance their sense of closeness. To exemplify my point, reports suggest that most people don't talk to their family while watching TV together.

{"id": "id_860", "input": "Everyone needs a break from their busy routines, and students are no exception; they too need vacations to escape their demanding academic schedules. Some advocate for a single, extended vacation during the school year because it can help students begin their studies or academic year with renewed enthusiasm for learning. Others, however, prefer multiple short breaks throughout the year, allowing students to periodically recharge. In both cases, students find relief. Nonetheless, I believe that multiple shorter breaks will keep students engaged and active in their studies.\nTo start with, Having several breaks spread throughout the year can help reduce stress levels among students. Many educational institutions plan shorter vacations post-term exams to alleviate exam stress for students. On the other hand, Research conducted by universities indicates that students perform better when they have regular intervals away from studying, preparing, and testing. In many foreign universities, students are given breaks after each semester, allowing them to relax and gear up for the next term. Moreover, These breaks enable students not only to unwind but also to gather funds and materials like books and references for upcoming courses.\nSecondly, scientific studies offer credible surveys on students' performance post-break. They indicate that Students' ability to learn enhances after a refreshing vacation. For example, At my school, we would have several breaks following our quarterly exams. During these breaks, I would review my exam performance and revisit questions or concepts to prevent repeating mistakes. I also spent time developing new hobbies or learning sports and games. Throughout my vacations, I would miss school, which made me return with a strong desire to learn and achieve high marks in the next quarter.\nBreaks are essential not only for students but also for professionals and homemakers. Since These breaks provide a respite from daily commitments and offer time for personal reflection, easing stress, and reigniting the motivation to return to regular routines.

But, have you ever considered that television has disrupted communication among friends and family? I believe this is one of the detrimental effects television has imposed on us.\nFirstly, due to the fact that people excessively consume television, they may become detached from social interactions. For instance, children who focus more on movies and music shows on television tend to neglect activities like attending school or exercising with friends, leading to their social isolation. Over time, they are left out by their peers in both activities and academics.\nSecondly, with the fast-paced evolution of living standards, it is increasingly common for families to have three or four televisions, one in each room. Both parents and children prefer watching TV in their separate rooms rather than engaging in conversations. As a result, children tend to mimic behaviors from television rather than learning from their parents. Furthermore, parents fail to provide essential parental guidance to their children. In this manner, the communication within families is evidently eroded.\nFinally, excessive television viewing leads people to inadvertently adopt negative behaviors that create divisions among individuals. For instance, watching films depicting terrorists might lead children to view terrorism as acceptable. What if they emulate the actions of terrorists portrayed in Hollywood movies? Could this be a reason for societal division?\nIn conclusion, although television does have its positive aspects, it has disrupted communication among friends and family.

By admitting equal numbers, universities will allow both genders to hone their skills and foster a competitive atmosphere.\nMixed-gender education facilitates better interaction between genders. It teaches them how to interact, cooperate, and collaborate effectively. For instance, Students from all-boys schools often lack experience in conversing or interacting with females. Conversely, Women attending all-girls schools tend to be overly shy when dealing with males. Mixed-gender education can help eliminate these shortcomings. By providing equal opportunities, universities prepare both genders for future challenges, benefiting them in the long term.\nSadly, Certain male chauvinists believe women lack competence in fields like mathematics, mechanical engineering, defense, etc.. Such gender-biased perspectives hinder societal progress. Time and again, Women have consistently demonstrated their capabilities across various domains. Figures like Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, and Marie Curie epitomize women's intelligence and expertise.\nTherefore, I strongly advocate that Both genders hold equal rights, and universities should admit them equally. Educational equality can drive societal advancement. Both genders are pivotal to society, with neither being superior or inferior. The choice of course should rest on the student's preference and merit, regardless of gender. Educational rights should be afforded to both genders.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay062", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 262, "to": 338}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 340, "to": 418}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 420, "to": 470}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 497, "to": 547}], "label": "Claim", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 549, "to": 670}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 672, "to": 741}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 743, "to": 814}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 830, "to": 924}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 938, "to": 1017}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1019, "to": 1079}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1081, "to": 1204}], "label": "Claim", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1213, "to": 1333}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1335, "to": 1391}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1409, "to": 1487}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1489, "to": 1596}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1634, "to": 1708}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1710, "to": 1761}], "label": "Claim", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1763, "to": 1839}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}], "edges": [{"source": 3, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 12, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 16, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 3, 10, 11, 15, 16]}

Setting up the university brings several benefits, including more educational opportunities for local residents and job creation.

{"id": "id_869", "input": "A significant number of individuals believe that music should be a core subject in high school, while others argue that it's an unnecessary field and should at least be optional. In this essay, I will explore perspectives for both viewpoints.\nIt is evident that music holds significant power to positively influence human psychology and well-being. As a result, numerous universities offer music classes to their students allowing they experience and learn in harmony with music. It seems to me that students who dedicate much of their time to studying various academic subjects should have a means to manage the stress accumulated during school hours. In this scenario, music can serve as a beneficial and engaging remedy. Furthermore, when musical activities engage numerous participants, it fosters cooperation and teamwork, which is undoubtedly advantageous for their future. Indeed, students with limited academic achievements can find their strengths through music. As a result, a tranquil environment in the classroom can be cultivated.\nConversely, it is apparent that music can have numerous cognitive benefits for students. In our fast-paced world, however, the demand is not for students inclined towards music, but for those with strong academic skills. Thus, I concur with the majority because music is an art form that necessitates a particular mindset. More and more, students cannot achieve the anticipated benefits unless they develop a serious interest in it. Therefore, subjects like music and other recreational activities should be elective. Nowadays, with the accelerating pace of life, time is the most precious resource. From my perspective, students need to enhance their professional competencies by studying subjects related to their future careers, rather than focusing on playing instruments or singing.\nIn summary, I believe that to become a competitive professional, students must possess an advanced understanding of their specific field.

{"id": "id_871", "input": "Nowadays, closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras are extensively utilized in various settings. They are installed in schools, businesses, and other locations to keep an eye on ongoing activities. It's undeniable that CCTV offers numerous advantages, particularly in curbing crime and ensuring the safety of employees at a location. Nonetheless, some individuals argue that these cameras infringe on their privacy as they are under constant observation. Despite this, I firmly assert that CCTV cameras ought to be installed in every establishment to tackle the rising theft rates and to safeguard employees at their workplaces.\nTo begin with, the presence of CCTV cameras in the workplace can lead to a reduction in crimes like theft. This is due to the fact that if a store is targeted by thieves, footage from these cameras can provide evidence to track down the criminals. For instance, in Malaysia, law enforcement officers utilized CCTV footage to track and capture a gang of thieves who broke into a Seven Eleven store at midnight. Additionally, employees, aware of being under constant watch, are less inclined to steal from the stores. Therefore, it is evident that CCTVs should be installed in all workplaces to help lower crime rates.\nMoreover, in certain offices, employees frequently have to deal with irate or frustrated clients. Occasionally, interacting face-to-face with an upset customer can pose a physical threat to the employee. Consequently, having CCTV cameras installed can assist employees in avoiding these situations because customers are aware that their interactions are being recorded. In case of a dispute, the recorded footage can be used to verify what occurred and decide on further actions. In summary, these cameras can provide a degree of protection for workers from customers.\nFrom a different viewpoint, the deployment of CCTV cameras does generate debate. Critics of CCTV systems argue that their privacy is compromised by continuous camera surveillance. However, it's important to recognize that safety takes precedence over privacy, and prevention is preferable to dealing with negative consequences. Therefore, those opposing the system should attempt to understand the situation and take measures to protect themselves from becoming crime victims.\nIn conclusion, CCTV cameras are crucial and should therefore be installed in every establishment. The primary reason is to protect oneself from potential harm by intruders or thieves. While it's true that privacy can be compromised with the use of these cameras.

Different individuals may have varying views on whether to pursue a career similar to that of their parents. Personally, I believe that choosing a career that aligns with one's parents' profession can be advantageous for one's career. \nTo begin with, since parents are engaged in the same field, they are able to offer substantial support to their offspring, such as expertise and industry-specific insights. For instance, my father is a software developer, and he has taught me extensively about programming and computer science. Whenever I encounter a challenge, I consult him for guidance. Given that he possesses a wealth of experience, I can save a significant amount of time in problem-solving. This indeed gives me a competitive edge over my peers. Had I chosen a different field from my father, I would have encountered greater challenges than I currently do.\nNonetheless, considering that parents have been in their careers for decades, they have built up a substantial network within a specific industry. They possess profound insights and can provide considerable assistance to their children. For example, they are aware of which companies offer better benefits or educational opportunities. Furthermore, their friends in the same field might even assist by writing recommendation letters for certain companies. It is undeniable that a strong recommendation letter is extremely valuable in today's competitive world. While others are still working on their resumes, someone with a strong recommendation letter may have already advanced beyond the initial interview stage. \nSome might contend that, as times have changed, the job market conditions have completely transformed. Thus, choosing a career similar to one's parents' is not always the right choice. While I partially agree with this perspective, when it comes to predicting trends, no one can do so with certainty. The job market evolves at lightning speed, ensuring that it is impossible to foresee whether any job will remain in demand for 30 years or more.\nIn evaluating whether one should pursue a career similar to their parents', I have outlined several reasons that individuals can receive more support from their parents if they operate in the same industry.

Students have the option to study independently in the library, concentrating on topics they find challenging. For instance, A close friend of mine was in the same department as me at university. She was quick to learn and grasped everything in class rapidly. Consequently, she seldom attended classes but dedicated most of her time to clarifying difficult subjects. Ultimately, she graduated with excellent grades.\nSecondly, students shouldn't be obligated to attend lectures because students can allocate the time meant for classes to other beneficial pursuits if they already have a solid grasp of the class material. From my own experience, there were numerous instances where I skipped biology classes because my university didn't mandate attendance. Furthermore, I had pre-studied all the biology topics before starting university. As a consequence, I utilized the time allocated for biology classes to focus on my chemistry research and achieved an A+ in both biology and chemistry. \nTo sum up, I believe students should be aware of which activities to prioritize and manage their study time effectively.

However, some contend that government should impose regulations to curtail their expressions. I, on the other hand, concur only partially with this view and believe that artists should be granted the liberty to create, leading to extraordinary masterpieces.\nPrimarily, imposing restrictions on artists' creativity will inevitably diminish their creative potential over time. It is indisputable that when artists are afforded the chance to express themselves, they often think innovatively and produce remarkable works like paintings or films. For instance, artworks by Da Vinci and Michelangelo continue to be admired today as they were free from constraints during their time. In summary, without any restrictions, artists will produce more stunning and inspiring creations.\nMoreover, everyone has the right to share their views as long as they do not incite national discord. Currently, many nations endeavor to demonstrate their commitment to democracy. Art serves as a medium for critiquing social issues and government policies within a nation. To elucidate this, the renowned film '3 Idiots' featuring Amir Khan critiques an education system focused on rote learning rather than practical application. Therefore, the denial of free expression to artists infringes on human rights.\nExamining another viewpoint, there are certain downsides if artists operate without constraints. They may delve into topics that spark controversy within a country. To provide an example, Malaysia is a nation characterized by racial diversity where citizens coexist in harmony and peace. Should anyone highlight sensitive racial issues in their films or books, it could lead to societal unrest. Nevertheless, I maintain that artists are typically aware of their limits and are unlikely to risk tarnishing their reputation through reckless actions.\nIn conclusion, it is clear now that artists' creations should be free from restrictions. Permitting them the freedom to think allows them to express themselves fully as ideas naturally flourish when unhindered by constraints.

{"id": "id_880", "input": "A lot has been discussed about the significance of having good roommates and how they can influence our school life. Studies indicate that friends made during university often become lifelong companions, and this is especially true for roommates. From my perspective, the most vital trait of a roommate is being considerate. Meanwhile, another crucial attribute of a good roommate is effective communication. \nBeing considerate is always key in any relationship. For instance, a roommate lowers the volume of music or television at night. Sometimes we remain unaware of our actions until we experience them ourselves. Consistently considering the other's feelings before acting selfishly can greatly enhance the roommate relationship. Consequently, having a thoughtful roommate is extremely crucial to our academic life. This approach not only prevents disagreements but also helps in forming a friendship or even a familial bond.\nFurthermore, communication is equally essential for a harmonious roommate relationship. People have varying daily habits, like making the bed each morning. One person may find this task simple, while another might see it as a daunting undertaking. Deciding to move out simply because a roommate doesn't make the bed might be an overreaction. Hence, effective communication holds great importance because it helps to eliminate misunderstandings. Through communication, bonds are formed and we gain a better understanding of one another.\nTo sum up, there are numerous significant aspects about having a roommate that matter.

{"id": "id_881", "input": "While professors at universities primarily serve as educators, responsible for the crucial task of teaching, there's another significant role they play that deserves attention: conducting research. In my view, professors should dedicate more time to research rather than focusing solely on teaching students, and here are several reasons to support this.\nA professor is essentially a researcher or a specialist in a particular scientific discipline. They should maintain a strong enthusiasm for their area of expertise so that they can continuously advance in their field. Additionally, they can enhance their teaching capabilities. For example, the professor who left the most lasting impression during my university years was Mr. Yang, who was deeply involved in research and reading. He inspired us and taught us how to study more effectively on our own. My classmates unanimously rated him AAA, recognizing him as an outstanding teacher.\nStudents can acquire knowledge from textbooks, online resources, or instructors. However, but we must rely on professors when seeking involvement in research and pursuing personal growth. Without engaging in research, a professor cannot offer us such opportunities. Furthermore, a professor who is deeply immersed in research is constantly generating new ideas. They may inspire students to propose innovative suggestions. This is beneficial for both professors and students.\nUltimately, professors at universities are invaluable assets to society. They are pioneers in numerous fields including science, arts, culture, and more. Their research is essential for the rapid emergence of new technologies.

Yet, finding a neighborhood that fully satisfies our criteria is challenging. In my hometown, although we have nearly all the necessary public utilities, transportation remains lacking. Therefore, I strongly desire an expansion of public transportation options. Given that I encounter traffic jams on a daily basis, this issue seems to be worsening. \nInitially, more alternatives like subways or sky trains should be available in public transport. Consequently, residents would have multiple options for reaching their destinations. Because currently, buses are the sole form of public transportation in this area, this leaves locals with no alternatives. They are compelled to use buses as their only means to travel elsewhere. Introducing subways and sky trains would enhance convenience for them. For instance, commuters can plan their journeys using subway schedules. Conversely, this is not possible with bus travel. Additionally, this enhancement would indirectly alleviate road traffic issues. \nSecondly, the bus system only covers two routes in this locality. This poses a significant challenge. For example, if my destination isn't on a bus route, I must first travel to the central station to transfer buses. Clearly, this is a considerable waste of time. Expanding bus routes would facilitate easier travel for people.\nLastly, increasing public transportation options can reduce personal car usage. It also offers numerous benefits. For example, individuals can cut down on fuel expenses, which are rising. The consumption of essential energy resources will gradually decline, because people drive their personal vehicles less frequently.\nIn conclusion, transportation is a fundamental aspect that directly impacts people's quality of life.

{"id": "id_886", "input": "In recent times, the spotlight has been on various modes of transportation. Some argue that cars are the most convenient form of transit, while others believe that we should explore other transportation options considering environmental concerns. Personally, I firmly believe that we should introduce alternative transportation methods and international regulations to manage the use of automobiles. This essay will thoroughly outline several reasons for this viewpoint in the following sections.\nTo begin with, the rise in the number of cars contributes to environmental pollution. Given that emissions from vehicles and carbon dioxide negatively affect air quality, this leads to air pollution, which can cause respiratory issues for local residents. Consequently, it is essential to switch from cars to other transportation modes and enact laws to regulate cars.\nMoreover, an increase in cars results in severe traffic jams. once caught in traffic, we are compelled to waste a significant amount of time. Even worse, traffic jams frustrate drivers, leading to more road accidents. Hence, strategies to minimize car numbers and manage their ownership and use should be promptly devised and executed.\nTo address these issues, alternative transport options and international legislation on car use and ownership can be highly effective. Concerning the first point, alternative methods that produce fewer carbon emissions and pollutants than cars are ideal. For instance, a bicycle rental system has been introduced in numerous European nations. this system allows people to rent bicycles at district corners and travel to other areas for a small fee. Since bicycles do not emit carbon dioxide or harmful gases, making them a better option for environmental protection compared to cars. Concerning the second point, the enactment of international regulations can also be effective. For example, there are rules limiting car usage during certain times and restricting individuals to owning just one car. Therefore, these measures to cut down on car use can alleviate both traffic issues and environmental pollution.\nIn conclusion, although some people argue for the convenience of cars, I assert that due to environmental conservation and the reduction of traffic congestion, alternative transport methods and international car control laws are essential.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay031", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 281, "to": 398}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 512, "to": 581}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 594, "to": 666}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 668, "to": 751}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 767, "to": 864}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 876, "to": 926}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 928, "to": 1006}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1020, "to": 1082}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1091, "to": 1200}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1227, "to": 1335}], "label": "Claim", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1365, "to": 1455}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1471, "to": 1543}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1545, "to": 1649}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1657, "to": 1709}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1711, "to": 1784}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1815, "to": 1879}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1894, "to": 2000}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2013, "to": 2112}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2138, "to": 2183}], "label": "Claim", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2199, "to": 2352}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 19}], "edges": [{"source": 3, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 4, 8, 9, 18, 19]}

As a result, music brings me joy.\nSecondly, exercise provides another effective stress-relief strategy suitable for everyone. For example, I often have numerous thoughts on my mind, such as the challenging tasks at work that need timely completion. These issues sometimes cause difficulty in falling asleep due to stress. Hence, after work, I consistently engage in exercise, with jogging being my preferred activity. working out helps me fall asleep more easily. exercise not only alleviates my stress but also enhances my overall health.\nThirdly, meditation is also an effective means of stress reduction. When I'm overwhelmed with thoughts, leading to stress, I turn to meditation. meditation offers a straightforward way to unwind because it requires no special equipment and only takes a few minutes. a simple meditation technique involves sitting down, closing my eyes, and focusing on my breathing. these practices effectively help me relieve stress.\nIn summary, there are numerous effective methods to manage stress. From my perspective, music, exercise, and meditation are the most accessible activities for stress relief. they are simple and practical. everyone should make time for these activities to enhance physical well-being and mental clarity.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay282", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 219, "to": 339}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 350, "to": 397}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 604, "to": 649}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 651, "to": 726}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 741, "to": 760}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 772, "to": 852}], "label": "Claim", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1057, "to": 1144}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1146, "to": 1190}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1192, "to": 1266}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1277, "to": 1334}], "label": "Claim", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1413, "to": 1462}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1471, "to": 1532}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1534, "to": 1632}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1634, "to": 1684}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1774, "to": 1858}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1860, "to": 1889}], "label": "Claim", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1891, "to": 1987}], "label": "Claim", "id": 16}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 5, 9, 14, 15, 16]}

Yet, I find no logical basis in relying on luck to achieve one's objectives. As a result, I wholeheartedly endorse the notion that it is one's dedication and effort that truly enables them to reach their goals.\nTo begin with, relying solely on luck to accomplish everything is a substantial gamble. Luck is an elusive concept, and there is no assurance it will ever favor you. Should it fail, the disappointment would be significant. Rather, if you exert effort towards your aspirations, your hard work will at least bring you nearer to your ultimate goal. From my own experiences, my achievements have always been the result of my hard work rather than luck. Additionally, I have never faced the frustration of failing to reach my objectives.\nMoreover, if you hold the belief that diligent effort is the path to achievement, it transforms you into a person with foresight. In essence, those who prioritize hard work possess clarity about their objectives and understand their intended destination. They meticulously plan the journey towards achieving their goals and consistently assess their progress until they attain their desired outcome. Believing in luck leaves you without direction and uncertain of your path. For instance, a friend of mine, facing severe financial difficulties, regularly purchased lottery tickets with the hope of winning someday. He was under the illusion that winning the lottery would resolve his financial troubles. Nevertheless, to this day, his luck has yet to change, and his problems have only worsened. \nFurthermore, putting in the effort might also attract luck, propelling you beyond your initial target. Consider, for example, my supervisor diligently pursued his promotion. He examined every requirement necessary to qualify for the advancement. He discovered that obtaining a master's degree would significantly boost his credentials, helping him outperform his rivals. Even though despite numerous obligations at home and work, he managed to complete the degree before being eligible to apply. Ultimately, he secured the promotion amidst fierce competition and was also nominated for an international scholarship because he possessed more qualifications than his peers in similar roles. \nWhile being fortunate is beneficial, placing reliance on luck for everything is unwise. Thus, I firmly advocate for diligent effort, which seldom leads to the disappointment that luck can sometimes bring.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay203", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 109, "to": 179}], "label": "Claim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 235, "to": 313}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 330, "to": 401}], "label": "Claim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 403, "to": 479}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 481, "to": 536}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 546, "to": 659}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 686, "to": 762}], "label": "Claim", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 778, "to": 846}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 990, "to": 1101}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1103, "to": 1246}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1248, "to": 1321}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1337, "to": 1461}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1463, "to": 1550}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1566, "to": 1642}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1658, "to": 1746}], "label": "Claim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1771, "to": 1817}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1819, "to": 1889}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1891, "to": 2014}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2028, "to": 2139}], "label": "Premise", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2141, "to": 2259}], "label": "Premise", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2268, "to": 2332}], "label": "Premise", "id": 20}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2341, "to": 2370}], "label": "Premise", "id": 21}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2372, "to": 2421}], "label": "Claim", "id": 22}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2429, "to": 2538}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 23}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 18, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 19, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 19, "target": 20, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 22, "target": 21, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 6, 8, 14, 22, 23]}

The subsequent paragraphs provide reasons supporting this perspective.\nFirstly, not everyone can travel abroad to study a foreign language because it demands a significant amount of money and involves numerous legal procedures. In past times, finding a teacher to learn a foreign language was challenging. However, thanks to globalization, finding a teacher in one's own country is now straightforward. For instance, in the Indian subcontinent, numerous centers have been established to offer training in various languages such as French and German.\nSecondly, foreign language courses have been integrated into the curricula of colleges and universities. students have the option to select any language from those offered by the university. Consequently, learning a foreign language domestically has become quite simple. Furthermore, well-qualified foreign language instructors are readily available in numerous educational institutions.\nThirdly, technology has significantly contributed to narrowing the gap between learning a foreign language abroad and at home. a wide selection of online foreign language courses is accessible, along with various forums for discussing issues related to different languages.\nIn conclusion, learning a foreign language in one's native country is preferable. it is more economical, and there are now ample opportunities available for this.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay299", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 323, "to": 413}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 495, "to": 553}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 562, "to": 641}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 643, "to": 719}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 730, "to": 816}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 832, "to": 963}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 975, "to": 1068}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1070, "to": 1154}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1170, "to": 1234}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1249, "to": 1351}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1362, "to": 1478}], "label": "Claim", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1480, "to": 1625}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1642, "to": 1707}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1709, "to": 1788}], "label": "Claim", "id": 13}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 4, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 4, 8, 10, 12, 13]}

Without adequate training and expertise, they wouldn't be able to excel in their respective careers. Furthermore, being in a university allows them to exchange knowledge and network with potential business partners and associates. This networking can be advantageous when they choose to establish their own companies or healthcare facilities.\nOn the other hand, there are also numerous individuals who achieve remarkable success in their fields without attending university. Consider those who venture into entrepreneurship. These entrepreneurs rely heavily on perseverance and luck. Interestingly, for many, this path has led to lucrative endeavors. For instance, Michael Dell, the founder and CEO of Dell, left college at the age of 19. Originally, He initiated his computer business from his dorm room. Ultimately, He leveraged his earnings and a family loan to achieve his current status.\nMoreover, Individuals with innate talents are also more likely to thrive in life. This holds particularly true in fields such as entertainment and sports. The rising number of reality shows offers opportunities for the fortunate to succeed.

From my perspective, health is the most vital aspect of an individual's life, and happiness and well-being are intrinsically linked to good health.

This is due to the fact that even though they are following their passion, their earnings are often lower compared to many other professions.\nConversely, I maintain that being passionate about one's work can lead to success in that particular domain. many successful individuals today began in demanding and competitive fields such as singing, dancing, and painting. Moreover, other critical factors in job selection include happiness, job satisfaction, personal relationships, professional skills, work environment, and relationships with managers and colleagues. Lastly, some people pursue careers based on their desire to help others and make a positive impact on their communities and societies.\nTo sum up, it is indisputable that salary remains a significant factor influencing career decisions.

There are numerous perspectives on what the core traits of successful people are. Personally, I believe one key reason for endorsing this idea is that individuals who achieve success gain essential and highly valuable insights from venturing into new experiences. Another reason is that attaining significant success necessitates taking substantial risks.\nThere are always intriguing and practical lessons that prosperous people can only acquire by exploring new opportunities. For instance, if you aim to enhance your communication skills, you might try something novel like engaging in sales across diverse stores and locations. By participating in sales, you will encounter various individuals with diverse behaviors and personalities, and consequently, you will develop strategies for interacting with people in various situations and occupations in the future. These insights are attainable solely through exploring new ventures and are not always accessible through reading. \nI genuinely believe that achieving substantial success mandates taking considerable risks. To secure substantial profits from investments, you should commit significant capital to high-risk financial strategies where the potential for loss is considerable. For remarkable outcomes in a crucial exam, one should take the risk of dedicating all their time to studying, foregoing leisure activities and favorite pastimes. The greater the risks you undertake, the more pronounced your achievements will be. Avoiding risks leads to a mundane life with mediocre accomplishments.

Unlike email, sending messages via traditional mail can result in loss or delivery to the wrong address. I can use telephones and email to directly communicate with those I wish to reach. For instance, right now, I am in the U.S. It is not feasible to have face-to-face conversations with my parents, who reside in my home country. As a result, I have the freedom to call or email my parents whenever I choose. Telephones and email have helped me maintain a sense of closeness with my parents.\nSecondly, Telephones and email can sometimes convey important messages more effectively than in-person communication. For example, Sometimes when I argue with my friends, I struggle to articulate my thoughts at that moment. Therefore, When I have time to reflect on the situation, I can convey my true thoughts without emotional interference.

{"id": "id_897", "input": "In today's world, the gap between educational institutions and societal realities is becoming increasingly pronounced. To help students adapt more swiftly to societal norms, parents should motivate their children to engage in part-time employment. There are several reasons underpinning my perspective.\nTo begin with, students have limited chances to learn about adult life at university. This is due to the fact that the majority of their interactions are with fellow students. On the other hand, part-time jobs expose students to a diverse range of individuals, most of whom are adults. Therefore, these adults can impart valuable insights into the nuances of adult life. My friend Lisa, currently holding a part-time job, remarks that it has been a fantastic experience. Through her part-time work, she has made friends with various people, gaining a broader perspective on adult life. For instance, Initially, Lisa believed work was central to adult life; however, after meeting her new friends, she realized responsibility is the true cornerstone, not work. Consequently, thanks to the insights shared by her new acquaintances, she now feels more assured about her future as an adult. \nMoreover, parents often emphasize that adult life is much more demanding than student life. Yet, because we haven't personally encountered this, it is challenging to grasp just how intense adult life can be. Thus, part-time jobs are necessary to provide a firsthand understanding of the challenges in adult life. In reality, surveys show that students with part-time jobs use their time wisely to prepare for the future and have more realistic expectations compared to those without such experiences. This leads to the conclusion that part-time work helps individuals gain a clearer understanding of their future.\nAdditionally, some parents worry that part-time employment could potentially interfere with students' academic performance. In actuality, most students opt to work part-time during holidays, so thus, it does not impact their studies. Compared to spending holidays playing computer games, part-time jobs are a far better option for students.\nIn summary, engaging in part-time work allows students to experience and better understand real adult life.

Nonetheless, a significant portion of the population opposes the establishment of a factory close to their neighborhood because of the pollution it may cause. Personally, the benefits of constructing a factory will outweigh its drawbacks, if environmental challenges posed by factories are effectively addressed.\nFirstly, a large factory can spur local economic development and help decrease unemployment rates. Manufacturing goods requires a workforce, thereby offering job opportunities to local inhabitants. Additionally, factories often act as catalysts for other industries and businesses, leading to the economic prosperity of the surrounding area. For instance, the real estate sector will flourish to meet the housing demands of the workforce.\nThe primary downside is pollution. It is a fact that certain regions endure severe repercussions from excessive industrial development, including water contamination, traffic congestion, and health issues. For example, in some industrial towns, a significant number of workers experience respiratory ailments, such as asthma, due to exposure to waste particles and specific chemicals.\nYet, the rise of more factories is an unavoidable aspect of societal progress. Hence, the focus should be on mitigating the negative impacts of factory construction rather than debating its necessity. Indeed, many issues can be prevented if factories earnestly commit to effective waste management.\nIn summary, the setup of manufacturing facilities is a hallmark of industrial advancement in numerous countries.

{"id": "id_902", "input": "When we watch films or television shows, some of us enjoy seeing virtuous characters rewarded and villains face justice. However, there are others who don't prefer this narrative. Personally, I like seeing good characters being rewarded. Nonetheless, I don't think it's appropriate for good characters to always have a happy ending.\nTo begin with, if every narrative concludes in the same manner, it becomes monotonous. Predictable outcomes occur if good characters perpetually triumph. This predictability diminishes our interest. Conversely, if virtuous characters aren't always victorious, we are compelled to watch to discover the conclusion. For instance, Hollywood narratives often end with heroes defeating villains and winning affection. However, many, myself included, have grown weary of this. I'm uninterested in repeatedly seeing similar conclusions. Hence, we shouldn't always allow good characters to be rewarded in films or TV shows.\nIn reality, even virtuous people sometimes face unfortunate outcomes. Moreover, I believe this occurs more frequently in life than it does in films. Therefore, children might develop unrealistic expectations if they consistently see virtuous characters being rewarded on TV. They could be misled by these narratives. Additionally, they may adopt good behavior solely for rewards. The realization that virtuous deeds aren't always rewarded might dishearten them, deterring good behavior. Yet in reality, good people continue their benevolent actions regardless of outcomes. Thus, it's essential to convey this understanding to young children to prevent misconceptions.\nIndeed, Occasionally, positive endings are beneficial. Some individuals may find motivation to do good. However, as previously mentioned, such motivation may be short-lived, because eventually, they will come to terms with reality. Therefore, I propose stories should reveal truths to audiences. Furthermore, if they understand this, they will strive to be good regardless of how stories end.\nBased on the arguments I've outlined, I believe films and TV shows ought to depict diverse narratives where good characters are sometimes rewarded and sometimes not.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay284", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 251, "to": 331}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 348, "to": 418}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 420, "to": 485}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 487, "to": 530}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 532, "to": 645}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 661, "to": 744}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 746, "to": 802}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 804, "to": 861}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 870, "to": 947}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 949, "to": 1017}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1039, "to": 1096}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1109, "to": 1222}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1224, "to": 1264}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1280, "to": 1327}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1329, "to": 1434}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1452, "to": 1520}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1528, "to": 1615}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1625, "to": 1670}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1672, "to": 1719}], "label": "Premise", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1755, "to": 1789}], "label": "Premise", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1799, "to": 1847}], "label": "Premise", "id": 20}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1870, "to": 1911}], "label": "Claim", "id": 21}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1926, "to": 2008}], "label": "Premise", "id": 22}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2058, "to": 2174}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 23}], "edges": [{"source": 8, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 16, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 17, "target": 18, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 17, "target": 19, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 19, "target": 20, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 21, "target": 17, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 21, "target": 22, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 8, 11, 21, 23]}

However, from my own perspective, I personally favor spending my free time outdoors because I firmly believe that it promotes good health and helps maintain physical fitness. Additionally, engaging in outdoor activities allows me to interact with others and appreciate nature's beauty.\nThere are significant benefits to enjoying leisure time outdoors. One advantage is that participating in outdoor sports like soccer and baseball benefits one's health. For example, last year, I devoted my summer to playing soccer and baseball. Baseball improved my upper body strength through hitting and throwing. Conversely, soccer enhanced my lower body strength and endurance for full 90-minute matches. I am convinced that engaging in these sports was immensely beneficial to me. Another positive aspect is that playing these sports keeps me fit and ultimately revitalized. After that summer, my strength and endurance improved significantly. \nOutdoor activities not only enhance my health but also provide opportunities to connect with more people. At the age of ten, I was a rather shy girl. My mother enrolled me in The National Camp. Initially, I spent time eating and playing by myself. But on the third day, a friendly girl approached me while I was swimming, and we became friends as she taught me efficient swimming techniques. The following day, we played together, and she introduced me to her group of friends. Thanks to her and outdoor activities such as skiing and mountain climbing, I've made many friends since attending The National Camp. Had I not participated in that camp, I wouldn't have as many friends as I do today. \nFurthermore, you can also take pleasure in nature's beauty through outdoor activities like hiking, sunbathing, and biking. Staying at home or engaging in similar activities prevents you from enjoying the beauty of nature. By spending time outdoors, individuals can inhale fresh air, feel the warmth of the sun, and enjoy the tranquility that only nature provides.\nWhile it's true that indoor activities can be enjoyable. It's undeniable that indoor pastimes like reading, watching TV, or listening to music can bring considerable joy. Even though I also find enjoyment in indoor activities, this benefit cannot surpass the allure of outdoor activities. Ultimately, people have their own preferences.

Furthermore, advertising helps consumers become familiar with companies and gain a thorough understanding of the products these companies offer.

Certainly not. It's equally absurd to think that global networks like Google or Yahoo sprang up by luck. While some argue that luck is the root of many achievements, I must disagree. I will elaborate on my main reasons here. \nTo start with, renowned individuals are often hard-working, not just fortunate. Diligence turns you into an expert, making you formidable in your profession. In other words, putting in hard work reduces the role of chance in achieving success. For instance, in football, it's often said that scoring from a penalty depends on luck. Statistically, the odds of scoring are fifty-fifty. However, I believe Ronaldo has a higher chance of scoring from a penalty than I do. This isn't because Ronaldo is luckier than I am. Undoubtedly, It's definitely because he practices and trains much more than I do. He trains extensively on the football field every day, so it's not because fortune favors him more than me.\nFurthermore, we can't always rely on luck to achieve success. While I don't deny luck's role in success, it's rarely a constant companion. For example, when preparing for TOEFL or other multiple-choice exams with four options per question. You can't prepare for it without studying and solely depend on luck, no matter how fortunate you are. Choosing randomly could lead to failing the exam. Without a doubt, It is wise to study hard to succeed in exams.\nLastly, Hard work and knowledge acquisition are essential before executing a project effectively. Even the luckiest people in the world cannot construct a car or erect a skyscraper purely by chance. These endeavors require expertise and mastery in one's field. Certainly, such individuals work diligently and accumulate significant experience through their efforts.\nIn conclusion, I believe any significant achievement demands hard work, not mere luck, even though luck is a contributing factor in reaching objectives, but its influence is incidental, and we shouldn't depend on luck in our planning.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay257", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 402, "to": 465}], "label": "Claim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 467, "to": 543}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 561, "to": 629}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 645, "to": 717}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 719, "to": 769}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 771, "to": 853}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 855, "to": 902}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 917, "to": 984}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 986, "to": 1039}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1044, "to": 1092}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1107, "to": 1154}], "label": "Claim", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1156, "to": 1231}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1246, "to": 1332}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1334, "to": 1434}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1436, "to": 1484}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1503, "to": 1547}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1557, "to": 1645}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1647, "to": 1746}], "label": "Claim", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1748, "to": 1808}], "label": "Premise", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1821, "to": 1913}], "label": "Premise", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1940, "to": 2000}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 20}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2014, "to": 2066}], "label": "Claim", "id": 21}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2072, "to": 2148}], "label": "Premise", "id": 22}], "edges": [{"source": 0, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 0, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 0, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 5, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 3, "target": 6, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 17, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 17, "target": 18, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 17, "target": 19, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 21, "target": 22, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 10, 17, 20, 21]}
{"id": "id_909", "input": "In our daily lives, we interact with various people and receive a range of feedback about ourselves or our work, whether it's positive or negative. While compliments are often easy to accept, criticism can be challenging. This leads to the notion that individuals who cannot accept criticism from others are unlikely to thrive in collaborative environments. Personally, I concur with this viewpoint.\nTo begin with, the essence of teamwork lies in achieving \"consensus\". It emphasizes the importance of everyone's opinion. In collaborative efforts, team members come together for brainstorming sessions, consider all possible solutions, and eventually reach a consensus. During this extended discussion process, diverse opinions are bound to emerge. It fails if a member stubbornly clings to their own idea and ignores others' critiques because the project is a collective endeavor, not a solo performance for any one individual. Every member has the responsibility to honor others' viewpoints.\nFurthermore, accepting criticism is a commendable trait as it involves considering opinions that differ from your own. Even outside group settings, it's important to accept criticism from others. Criticism can be painful because it highlights your weaknesses and compels you to address them. However, criticism can help you recognize these weaknesses and correct them if you are open to it. Those who dismiss criticism entirely will ultimately miss opportunities for self-improvement. Essentially, if you can't accept any form of criticism, you'll struggle not only in teamwork but also in personal endeavors. As a Chinese proverb says: \"Good medicine tastes bitter\". Criticism can be a potent remedy for healing.\nYet, some might wonder: what if the criticism turns out to be incorrect? What if I was initially right, but the seemingly valid criticism led me astray? Isn't persistence also a valuable trait? From my perspective, criticism remains beneficial even if you are correct because in such cases, it not only acts as a corrective but also as a way to evaluate your understanding of your work. Embracing criticism doesn't mean you have to accept all of it. You should also exercise your own judgment! And knowing how to make the most of criticism is an art.\nIn summary, criticism is crucial, especially in teamwork, but it remains necessary in other contexts as well. It's akin to a discerning mirror that reveals our flaws, prompting us to strive for greater beauty and confidence.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay251", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 252, "to": 356}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 415, "to": 468}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 470, "to": 520}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 522, "to": 668}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 749, "to": 835}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 844, "to": 927}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 929, "to": 992}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1007, "to": 1111}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1113, "to": 1188}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1190, "to": 1214}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1223, "to": 1284}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1295, "to": 1383}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1385, "to": 1477}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1492, "to": 1602}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1604, "to": 1660}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1662, "to": 1706}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1923, "to": 1975}], "label": "Claim", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1984, "to": 2093}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2095, "to": 2156}], "label": "Premise", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2158, "to": 2200}], "label": "Premise", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2202, "to": 2257}], "label": "Premise", "id": 20}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2271, "to": 2367}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 21}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 8, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 11, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 16, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 16, "target": 18, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 16, "target": 19, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 16, "target": 20, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 8, 16, 21]}

The existing high school is in dire need of updated educational materials and renovations for sports facilities. Moreover, the physics and chemistry labs were in poor condition, resulting in students are unable to effectively learn during classes. In the new school, they will approach their studies with renewed vigor and enthusiasm. \nSecondly, the new high school will serve as a hub for fostering connections among students from various communities and districts. After school, students, along with others, will gather at the high school to partake in different competitions. For example, following a football match, students from various high schools will interact and maintain contact. This will enhance students' social networks. The sole downside is the noise from the competitions. Residents in the vicinity might be slightly bothered, yet I believe this isn't a substantial reason to halt the competitions. \nIn conclusion, this new development offers numerous advantages, such as fostering connections among students from diverse communities, and the new educational tools will boost students' enthusiasm for learning.

While some argue that all students should have the opportunity to pursue higher education, I believe that advanced training should be reserved for a select group of proficient and knowledgeable students.\nFirst, prioritizing talented students is a more effective approach because it enables educational institutions to uphold high standards of education. Unlike secondary education, university and college demand significant abilities and skills to manage the vast and intricate knowledge presented. Indeed, some students may excel in high school, yet the rigors of higher education are challenging even for the gifted. This is why it's suitable for only a select few, and making it accessible to everyone could be detrimental to institutions, since they might have to simplify the curriculum, making it less challenging for everyone.\nSecondly, universities should admit only capable students because it results in a more skilled workforce for complex tasks.

These standard jobs will always be available for everyone, while more intricate positions should be filled by top individuals who have graduated from the best institutions. I believe restricting university admissions to a select group is a wise decision since it encourages student motivation and consistently challenges them, prompting them to strive for self-improvement.

Additionally, the increase in sea levels due to global warming poses a danger to human life in numerous nations.

Conversely, children and teenagers, lacking financial independence, are more prone to impulsively buying items without assessing their actual need, because they are free from financial burdens and often struggle to determine what is truly necessary.\nPersonally, I believe the decision to purchase is ultimately a personal choice, not entirely dictated by advertisements.

In this regard, I firmly believe that studying art and music should be mandatory.\nTo begin with, art and music expand students' horizons, encouraging them to become more reflective. It's widely recognized that art and music transcend national boundaries, uniting people globally and representing diverse cultures. In such a scenario, by learning about art and music, students can appreciate the masterpieces of renowned artists and musicians, and experience the allure of various cultures.

Clearly, with the fast pace of modern life, people are under tremendous stress from academics or work, which can be destructive unless they find a way to relieve it. Art and music are, undeniably, the most accessible means for contemporary individuals to free themselves from overwhelming stress. Immersing oneself in a masterpiece like the Mona Lisa allows people to set aside their worries and ponder the meaning behind its enigmatic smile. At this point, they become completely absorbed in the art, and their stressed nerves find relief. Evidently, this appreciation for art stems from an initial education in the arts.\nCertainly, studying art and music should be guided by the interests of younger students. art and music education is ineffective if students are unwilling participants. Hence, schools should consider replacing some basic science classes with art and music to spark students' interest without adding to their academic burden.\nIn conclusion, in today's world, comprehending the vastness and intricacies of life is vital, and simultaneously, people are overwhelmed by excessive pressure, art and music education for younger students should not be marginalized.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay261", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 258, "to": 342}], "label": "Claim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 351, "to": 478}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 518, "to": 560}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 577, "to": 660}], "label": "Claim", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 662, "to": 792}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 814, "to": 968}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 983, "to": 1089}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1102, "to": 1195}], "label": "Claim", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1206, "to": 1361}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1363, "to": 1492}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1494, "to": 1638}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1655, "to": 1736}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1749, "to": 1818}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1831, "to": 1907}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1909, "to": 1986}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1995, "to": 2142}], "label": "Claim", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2159, "to": 2302}], "label": "Claim", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2304, "to": 2375}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 17}], "edges": [{"source": 0, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 2, 3, 7, 15, 16, 17]}

I believe that it is crucial to save a portion of your income because the future is unpredictable in terms of both professional and personal aspects, and having savings can help you achieve some of your aspirations.\nTo begin with, there are numerous uncertainties regarding your career path. The current global economy is challenging, with many unforeseen variables necessitating the need for a financial cushion. For instance, I recall some friends who recently lost their jobs due to the economic downturn in Europe. A number of them lacked personal savings. They were unable to pay their rent, thus they had to return to their families, sacrificing their independence.\nMoreover, the course of personal life is equally unpredictable. In the future, you might encounter unavoidable expenses that would be unaffordable without savings. I remember a friend from university who had minimal savings and faced a significant car repair. He couldn't cover the repair costs, therefore he ended up having to sell the car.\nLastly, having savings allows you to purchase luxury items and realize your dreams.

Engaging in physical activities fosters a healthy populace, enhances learning through firsthand experience, and ultimately contributes to a nation's economic growth. \nTo begin with, there's an age-old Latin saying: \"Anima sana in corpore sano\", which translates to a healthy body forms the foundation for a healthy mind. There exists a direct connection between individuals' health and the regularity of performing physical activities. The more we engage in physical exercise, the better our overall well-being. Moreover, it is evident that consistent physical activity can enhance health conditions: gradually, with each step, we can improve our physical state. Consequently, if everyone in the nation starts participating in sports from their school years and continues daily, it could eventually cultivate a healthy population.\nAdditionally, engaging in both outdoor and indoor sports brings clarity to many aspects. For instance, a person who jogs daily can ultimately gain insights into their own body through firsthand observation. Similarly, the school basketball team acquires more effective strategies for specific ball-throwing techniques through practice rather than theoretical learning. Furthermore, almost all discoveries in natural sciences have been achieved through direct observation, which is integral to physical education. \nLastly, but certainly not least, the economic stability of a region largely hinges on the health of its inhabitants. For example, funds allocated to physical education programs can reduce healthcare expenses, because the population is relatively healthy. In addition to that, individuals who are physically fit can contribute significantly to both economic and social progress. Indeed, the better one's physical condition, the more efficiently their brain functions. Thus, incorporating physical exercises in the early stages of human growth would ultimately result in a mentally healthy society.

There are those who assert that tourism leads to domestic economic disruption, environmental ruin, and irreversible harm to the locations it takes advantage of. Nonetheless, I firmly refute this misconception for the following reasons.\nFirstly, tourism is vital for fostering economic growth in the way it is intended. Essentially, tourist attractions are often situated in remote areas, where the economy had not flourished before their emergence. It is only with the investment from certain companies that hotel chains and services begin to proliferate. This inevitably draws significant attention, accompanied by substantial income for the local community. In other words, tourism redirects the local economy towards its optimal path, maximizing its inherent potential.\nSecondly, although environmental degradation is unavoidable, tourism should not be held accountable for this. To transform a wild area into a tourist attraction, planners must meticulously consider the preservation of the scenery. Specifically, for example, a significant amount is invested in pruning trees, nurturing flowers, and maintaining a balance between the local wildlife and plant life, aiming to enhance the natural beauty. Moreover, ecotourism, a novel environmentally-friendly service, assists environmentalists and nature enthusiasts in promoting awareness about protecting coexisting species. As a result, tourism should not be accused of being infamous for harming ecological diversity.\nAll things considered, tourism has demonstrated a positive approach towards exploited areas in terms of financial and environmental effects.

Additionally, images are extensively utilized in newspapers, magazines, and advertising. Hence, it is indisputable that images alone can captivate a wide audience.\nFrom another angle, written language is crucial for conveying specific messages. Without accompanying text, individuals interpret images according to their own perspectives. However, this differs when words are employed to clarify the content of the illustration. Furthermore, the primary method of instructing students also relies on this approach. Modern academic textbooks are filled with text along with images to assist readers in better understanding.\nIn conclusion, images and text complement each other, and neither aspect can be solely prioritized over the other.

Nonetheless, there is concern among some individuals that industrialized countries might achieve their economic goals at the detriment of the environment. In my opinion, I believe prosperous economies can coexist with environmental conservation.\nUndoubtedly, certain nations might prioritize economic growth over environmental safeguarding, leading to deterioration of the local environments. Because these impoverished countries lack sufficient financial and human resources, cutting-edge technologies, and expertise, they must depend on natural resources to sustain their living conditions. Furthermore, individuals in poverty-stricken regions are unlikely to possess the knowledge necessary for ecosystem conservation. Consequently, unregulated and excessive exploitation of local raw materials may occur, stressing the natural resources. In this regard, economic progression and environmental conservation can clash.\nYet, I am convinced that a thriving economy can be intimately connected to environmental conservation. As people become more conscious of sustainable economies, non-polluting products are becoming more popular among consumers, indicating that eco-friendly companies can leave a positive impression on today's customers, driving sales. For instance, electric bicycles powered by renewable energy sources have gained popularity among the population in recent years.\nMoreover, valuing environmental impacts can improve operational efficiency. A company that is environmentally aware might have to utilize its resources optimally to enhance its production processes and machinery, which can lead to increased productivity. Hence, it can drive its economic growth. Conversely, without the obligation of environmental conservation, the company would continue to consume large amounts of energy, which makes up a significant portion of its operational expenses, hindering economic growth.\nIn conclusion, I assert that economic success and ecosystem protection can be advanced concurrently.

{"id": "id_929", "input": "While smoking can offer individuals a great deal of pleasure and stress relief, it should not come at the expense of others' health. Therefore, I strongly support the notion that smoking should be banned in dining establishments and other public areas, and we ought to endorse state legislation to enforce this prohibition because smoking detrimentally impacts the atmosphere of the restaurant and poses a health risk to others.\nTo begin with, even though it's perhaps an overstatement to say smoking should be banned absolutely everywhere, smoking in restaurants is seen as prioritizing personal enjoyment over others' well-being, it is widely recognized that second-hand smoke emitted by smokers is more harmful to the surrounding individuals' health than to the smoker. For instance, if a single person smokes in a dining area, everyone else is passively smoking, which jeopardizes their health. This is due to the fact that certain chemicals in cigarettes can rapidly impair a person's respiratory health once inhaled. Consequently, smoking should be completely forbidden in dining venues because it turns the restaurant into a polluted environment that endangers every patron's health.\nMoreover, despite some diners not being overly concerned about the dangers of second-hand smoke, the unpleasant smoke significantly reduces their desire to eat, thus ruining their dining experience. Smoke exhaled from smokers often leads to discomfort or aversion in others, negatively impacting their dining mood. This can, in turn, lead to a decline in the restaurant's popularity as fewer customers are inclined to visit due to their negative experiences.\nIn addition, smoking offers no benefits to the smoker. It not only worsens their health, increasing susceptibility to respiratory ailments, but also tarnishes their public image. This is especially pertinent for well-known politicians or entertainment figures, because the general public perceives smoking in restaurants as discourteous behavior. At this juncture, people may conclude that the smoker lacks basic manners and should not be considered for leadership roles.\nIn summary, smoking in a dining setting is both harmful and disrespectful. It damages the smoker's reputation and endangers the health of others.

For example, many developing nations suffer from a shortage of educational assets, such as skilled educators, assessment systems, and teaching infrastructure, often overlooked by local governments. This illustration makes it clear that if wealthy nations are reluctant to share their successful educational practices, the developing nations will remain stagnant, even if they receive substantial economic aid. Consequently, the fundamental way to elevate the situation in impoverished countries is to assist them in establishing a comprehensive educational framework rather than solely providing financial assistance.\nFurthermore, it is well understood that nothing comes without a cost. This implies certain influential nations offer financial aid to gain the privilege to exploit local resources and access the labor force. Indeed, they seldom offer any technological support to local populations and sometimes even pollute certain regions.

They participate in various school activities. Consider a student who participates in a school jazz ensemble. He requires a superior auditorium to deliver an outstanding performance. Such a remarkable performance would provide the student with a deeply memorable and valuable experience. Consequently, from this scenario, we can assert that students would favor schools investing in facility enhancements.\nAdmittedly, some individuals might assert that schools should allocate funds towards hiring distinguished educators because they have the capability to effectively educate their students.

A student's success is determined not by having an exceptional teacher but by their own dedication to studying. Hiring a highly acclaimed teacher is futile if students are not motivated and diligent. \nConsidering the reasons outlined above, I am convinced that investing in facilities is the most advantageous approach for schools because the benefits of this outweigh those of the alternative. In other words, students can gain more advantages from enhanced facilities. This is not to completely dismiss other viewpoints.

Assistance from wealthier nations is vital for developing these areas in less affluent countries.\nTo begin with, In terms of healthcare, less affluent nations typically have fewer doctors and nurses compared to wealthier countries. A high population in poorer nations, stemming from inadequate family planning, results in an imbalance between the number of doctors and residents. Furthermore, The demand for medical services in poorer countries often exceeds the availability of hospitals. To address these challenges, Wealthier nations can aid by sending healthcare professionals and funding hospital construction in these impoverished regions.\nIn the second place, In terms of education, it is widely recognized that less affluent countries frequently experience a shortage of school teachers and university lecturers. Moreover, Education is generally not free in these countries, limiting access to only a select group of students who can afford it. To tackle the shortage of educational workforce, Wealthier countries can send experienced educators to train more teachers and lecturers in less affluent regions. Meanwhile, To address the issue of educational expenses, wealthier nations should provide scholarships and loans to eligible students.\nFinally, In terms of commerce, it is undeniable that poorer countries are trailing behind due to financial constraints. The lack of vibrant trade in poorer countries can also be attributed to inadequate transportation infrastructure. For instance, Individuals in rural areas still rely on their personal farms for food production. As an act of benevolence, Wealthier nations can support trade by offering financial services to poorer countries. Additionally, they can provide guidance on establishing a comprehensive and efficient transportation system to bolster trade.\nTo sum up, Wealthier nations must take on more responsibility in assisting poorer countries in healthcare, education, and commerce.

These tasks can range from minor to significant, but ultimately, they must be embraced because they are often tied to responsibilities. Additionally, engaging in such tasks can sometimes lead to personal growth and learning about life. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons why I believe that people should occasionally take part in activities they don\u2019t enjoy is essential. \nTo begin with, a significant portion of people's daily routines involves tasks that they find unpleasant. In our personal lives, we all have responsibilities toward others, and it's rare to find someone who enjoys every single one of these obligations. For instance, I find housework to be quite challenging; even though my husband helps with some of it, it still falls under my responsibility. I genuinely dislike doing housework, but I recognize that it is something I must do. \nSecondly, in professional settings, jobs often include tasks that are unavoidable and integral to the work. Few people enjoy attending dull meetings or collaborating with colleagues who lack interpersonal skills. I work as a research assistant at a university, and like many universities, we have a professor who struggles with interpersonal relationships. Although most assistants dislike interacting with him, we often have no choice because of his expertise. \nFinally, doing something one initially dislikes can sometimes lead to unexpected enjoyment. There are instances when people reluctantly participate in activities at the insistence of their friends. For example, One of our friends mentioned a dance class to my husband and me, even though neither of us was interested. After being persuaded by our friends, we decided to give it a try and ended up having a great time. We continued attending the course for six months, even though most of our friends dropped out after just a month. \nLife is not filled with endless enjoyment; life inevitably includes unpleasant and tedious moments, but many of these are tied to responsibilities that are integral to an individual's existence.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay330", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 432, "to": 499}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 530, "to": 619}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 621, "to": 766}], "label": "Claim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 782, "to": 908}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 910, "to": 993}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1006, "to": 1102}], "label": "Claim", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1104, "to": 1207}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1209, "to": 1456}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1468, "to": 1549}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1551, "to": 1655}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1670, "to": 1775}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1777, "to": 1989}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2035, "to": 2185}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 12}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 2, 5, 8, 12]}

I fully endorse this viewpoint.\nRecently, the proportion of women has been increasing steadily in many regions around the world. Naturally, this trend encourages stakeholders from diverse areas to contemplate the necessary measures for stabilizing economic growth and enhancing people's quality of life. It is evident that women are increasingly taking on roles in fields traditionally dominated by men, such as engineering and machinery.

Some suggest that the optimal approach to tackle this issue is by supplying the unemployed with smartphones that have Internet access. They argue that this is the best way to utilize public funds. However, I only partially agree with this proposal because I believe that providing unemployed individuals with smartphones is a complete misuse of funds.\nFrom a positive standpoint, when jobless individuals have smartphones with Internet access, they can explore more job opportunities online. For instance, they can visit The Star Online's job section to discover employment that suits them. The internet allows them to research potential jobs and learn how to prepare for them. Additionally, smartphones can also facilitate contacting companies they wish to join. In essence, if the government equips the unemployed with smartphones, they can secure jobs to sustain themselves.\nConversely, from a different angle, providing smartphones to the jobless squanders taxpayers' money. This is due to the fact that the funds could be redirected to more beneficial national projects. To further explain, the money might be better spent on public facilities or assisting the impoverished to earn a livelihood. In conclusion, the funds should be allocated to more constructive uses rather than distributing smartphones to the unemployed.\nMoreover, offering free smartphones may tempt many to exploit this opportunity. it wouldn't be surprising if people pretended to be unemployed just to receive a smartphone. some might even falsely claim unemployment to qualify for phones. In this scenario, this results in the frivolous expenditure of public funds. Furthermore, to date, there is no evidence or research supporting this method as effective in reducing unemployment.\nIn summary, the idea of giving internet-enabled smartphones to the jobless is neither an appropriate nor effective strategy to reduce unemployment.

In my view, enhancing roads and highways stands as the most viable solution to these issues due to three fundamental reasons.\nFirst and foremost, it is widely recognized that boosting public transportation will likely intensify pollution and accidents. Vehicles like buses, cars, and trains frequently emit harmful gases leading to severe diseases such as lung cancer and pneumonia. Additionally, the noise generated by engines can deteriorate our hearing abilities. Most significantly, a significant number of accidents occur on the roads. For instance, in my nation, buses are identified as a primary cause for the sharp rise in accidents. Annually, Vietnam sees nearly twelve thousand fatalities annually due to accidents, paralleling the death toll from the tsunami in Japan.\nSecondly, investing in roads and highways can expand the space available, facilitating more public transportation operations. Both buses and private vehicles can navigate the roads with ease. For example, I routinely leave school at a time when everyone floods the roads, rushing home. It proves extremely challenging to break free from the congestion on the roads within an hour. Conversely, with wider roads, people can reach home more swiftly, reducing the chances of collisions.\nFinally, allocating funds for highway and road renovations can elevate their quality. Many are apprehensive about traveling on roads riddled with potholes. Such poor conditions lead to numerous severe accidents and instill anxiety in many. Blaming drivers for accidents is unjust, as a portion of the blame lies with the authorities.

{"id": "id_943", "input": "There is a debate where some individuals believe that governments should allocate funds to enhance roads and highways, while others argue that investing in public transportation would be more beneficial. Personally, governments should undoubtedly prioritize investing in the public transportation infrastructure as it addresses issues caused by the increasing number of private vehicles.\nInitially, utilizing public transportation diminishes the consumption of resources dedicated to transit. Automobiles rely on gasoline, which is a finite resource. Consequently, an increase in car usage accelerates the depletion of global gasoline reserves. Conversely, effective use of public transport significantly reduces the per capita gasoline consumption. Moreover, this undeniably contributes to the preservation of our precious natural resource, gasoline.\nSecondly, public transportation plays a crucial role in combating air pollution. On average, public transport systems consume considerably less gasoline compared to private vehicles. This implies that opting for public transport leads to reduced emissions, alleviating the congested and polluted conditions on the roads.\nFinally, public transportation offers a much safer alternative than private vehicles. Data from the National Safety Council indicates that traveling by bus is over 170 times safer than using private cars. Therefore, there is ample justification for governments to invest in public transportation, which is a healthier, safer, and more cost-effective mode of travel.\nIn conclusion, I am confident that investing in the enhancement of public transportation is crucial as it is vital for safeguarding our planet and fostering a healthy and secure environment for residents.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay198", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 216, "to": 311}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 315, "to": 386}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 399, "to": 491}], "label": "Claim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 493, "to": 549}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 565, "to": 643}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 657, "to": 748}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 760, "to": 850}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 862, "to": 931}], "label": "Claim", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 945, "to": 1033}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1035, "to": 1171}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1182, "to": 1257}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1259, "to": 1376}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1389, "to": 1537}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1574, "to": 1638}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1642, "to": 1742}], "label": "Claim", "id": 14}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 7, 12, 13, 14]}

While some agree that watching TV is a more effective learning method for certain children, I find it hard not to resist the idea of students spending increased time on televisions. This is because traditional education remains the most suitable approach for many. Hence, encouraging physical inactivity for the purpose of enhancing children's abilities should be avoided.\nFirstly, conventional teaching methods have been scientifically validated and utilized as the optimal way to educate a child. Advancements in technology have positively impacted the education sector to some extent. However, it has not diminished the significance of teachers in classrooms. The fact that students nowadays completing their homework or research online rather than in libraries exemplifies this. Yet, screens cannot substitute the presence of educators because their expertise and adaptability are invaluable. Consequently, teachers cannot be replaced with unthinking screens. \nSecondly, watching TV is a passive activity and should not be encouraged by increasing the time spent on it. Conversely, children engaged in activities that foster creativity, teamwork, and competition tend to excel overall. For example, an experiment showed that children who experienced nature activities outperformed those who spent most of their time watching documentaries in differentiating types of plants or animals. As a consequence, such activities can provide a child with essential skills for their future career.\nIn summary, despite the notion that learning through TV is suitable for some children, children should never be encouraged to partake in such passive activities.

{"id": "id_945", "input": "A contentious topic revolves around whether in-person communication surpasses other forms of interaction, and its complexity allows for multiple perspectives. Some assert that face-to-face communication is the most effective form of expression, while others hold conflicting views. After careful consideration, I have formed my own opinion. I support the former view, which is that I agree that face-to-face communication is better. \nThe primary reason stems from the undeniable truth that communicating in person can be more convincing. Sometimes, face-to face communication can lead us to convince or complain someone successfully, and a fitting example can be found from my uncle. He once complained a service of a restaurant. Without exaggeration, he directly went to the boss and told the boss that something wrong occurred on the meal--a fly concealed in it. Afterward, my uncle acquired a new service thanks to face-to face communication. If he just wrote something to complain on the website or by telephone, I do not think this problem would be thought important. Consequently, we can commence to agree that communicating with someone in person is the best way. \nBesides the point I mentioned earlier, another critical factor is that it is easy to be deceived without face-to face communication. For example, I had received some harmful words on facebook from my best friend, Eric. He said that I was totally failed in building a good friendship and he did not want to be one of my friends anymore. I just shocked and did not know what happened. Ultimately, I realized that his facebook account was stolen. Therefore, from this incident, we are capable of stating that it is important to talk to people face-to-face. \nAdmittedly, some dissenters might argue that communication by letters, email, or telephone can enable them to talk without scruple, which is also one of the most important parts in communication. However, from my limited perspective, I question the reliability of that claim. It is conceivable that before we talk, it is necessary for us to be imprudent about our words. Talking without scruple is not the indispensable part in communication; in contrast, it is usually detrimental to us. \nConsidering the reasons outlined above, I prefer to express my opinion in person because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In essence, I believe the best way of communication is by means of face-to-face. This does not imply, of course, that other viewpoints lack merit entirely.

Some believe that this trend mirrors and exacerbates the prevalent violence within society. I wholeheartedly concur with this perspective for several specific reasons, which will be explored and discussed in the following sections.\nFirstly, it is crucial to recognize that police equipped with firearms or other sanctioned weapons aim to safeguard not only the public but also themselves. Consequently, today's criminals are highly sophisticated, investing heavily in acquiring advanced weaponry to confront law enforcement and fulfill their malevolent objectives. Therefore, individuals in such a society risk being inadvertently shot by both law enforcement and criminals. Furthermore, during operations, not only do civilians suffer, but infrastructure such as vehicles, residences, and streets are likely to be damaged by firearms. Hence, a society where its police force is armed will undoubtedly be perceived as notably violent.\nSecondly, police forces carry firearms exclusively in societies with high crime rates. As a result, individuals and law enforcement in such environments frequently encounter various hazardous crimes like theft, robbery, murder, rape, vandalism, and arson. Clearly, These represent possibly the most compelling evidence of a society grappling with elevated levels of violence.\nIn summary, from the aforementioned points, even though arming the police with firearms is essential, it will lead to increased violence levels.

Having a teacher can help avoid confusion and enhance the pace and efficiency of learning. Additionally, it is crucial to note that for hands-on subjects, having a teacher is essential. Conversely, there are times when I prefer to learn alone.\nAn experienced teacher can facilitate quicker and easier learning. When tackling a challenging and confusing course with limited resources on my own, I often feel discouraged after investing significant time. In such cases, I seek assistance from a teacher. Subsequently, the teacher imparts the course knowledge swiftly and effectively, leading to the fact that I will learn more quickly and effectively, avoiding confusion and discouragement.\nCertain practical subjects require a teacher or instructor for effective learning. For instance, Learning to drive, pursuing careers like medicine and engineering, or engaging in sports like skiing and swimming necessitates finding a teacher. Mastering these skills on one's own is nearly impractical and ineffective. Incidentally, when self-studying, there's a risk of misunderstanding or mislearning concepts! Take for example, Reflecting on my experience with guitar playing, I initially developed bad habits in strumming and tempo without a teacher, but corrected them with a tutor's guidance.\nCertain topics I prefer to explore independently as I save money by not hiring a teacher and avoid time spent commuting to classes. Today, abundant resources like books, e-books, the internet, and satellite TV are available. I can use these tools as guides for various subjects.

To a certain degree, I disagree with this notion, as I am convinced that it is the criminal mentality that fosters violence, not strict gun regulations. \nFirstly, it appears plausible that implementing gun control should theoretically lead to a reduction in crime because a decrease in the availability of firearms correlates with reduced crime rates. Nevertheless, the situation is more complex than it initially appears. \nIndeed, strict gun regulations do not necessarily diminish violence and criminal activity due to the fact that most incidents of gun violence involve weapons acquired through illegal means. Individuals determined to commit crimes and dominate areas through gang-related violence or other methods will find ways to access firearms, irrespective of gun control measures. \nFurthermore, there will always be individuals who disregard laws, whether they are police officers or ordinary citizens. Consequently, the true source of violence lies in the criminal mindset, not the weapon itself. Thus, if a government aims to reduce community crime, it should manage the behavior of its citizens rather than focusing solely on the firearms used in violent acts. \nUltimately, it is clear that the connection between police carrying firearms and a rise in violence is weak.

Many individuals may work their entire lives and never reach this level of income. This disparity in earnings between these celebrities and the rest of us raises the question: do these professional athletes and entertainers merit such high earnings? From my perspective, I believe that they are justified in earning such high incomes.\nFirstly, an individual's salary can accurately reflect their skills and value in their profession. Consequently, those who earn substantial salaries must stand out and achieve extraordinary feats in certain aspects. Their earnings are not without reason. In the competitive world we live in, we must demonstrate our excellence to convince employers that we deserve higher compensation. This principle applies to every profession. This is why the wealthiest athletes are often synonymous with the most outstanding in their fields, such as Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods.\nSecondly, such significant earnings can also ensure and enhance an athlete's extraordinary performances. Most people see only the glamorous side of wealthy athletes and overlook the challenges they've faced and the investments they've made in themselves. Their substantial salaries are a deserved reward. Put differently, if their earnings do not reflect their performances, we might not witness the spectacular displays that captivate us.\nSome might argue that the disparity between wealthy athletes and ordinary people is so vast that it seems unjust. Nonetheless, in my view, as long as everyone has equal opportunities to chase their dreams and careers, it is fair. Fairness is not about equal pay for all, but about equal opportunities to achieve the same goals or successes.\nTo sum up, high earnings for athletes are deserved based on their own accomplishments and also serve as an assurance of quality performances.

Furthermore, Reality TV involves programs where individuals are placed in contrived settings and scenarios, such as \"Big Brother\".\nIn conclusion, it is evident that television, magazines, and newspapers devote excessive attention to people's private lives due to the reasons outlined above: to amplify audience or readership and to cater to a society that thrives on sensationalist media and tabloid television.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay307", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 298, "to": 346}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 388, "to": 482}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 484, "to": 605}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 607, "to": 660}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 680, "to": 768}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 794, "to": 857}], "label": "Claim", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 859, "to": 948}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 950, "to": 1087}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1102, "to": 1218}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1254, "to": 1499}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 9}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 5, 9]}

Some argue that these numerous advertisements persuade individuals to purchase items that are unnecessary and merely appear appealing on TV. I find myself agreeing with this perspective.\nTo enhance their sales figures and attract consumers, businesses invest heavily in advertising. Often, it's not the product's functionality or quality that matters, but rather the promoted positive feeling associated with owning it. In other words, large corporations recruit celebrities to endorse their products. When well-known singers are featured in TV commercials for items like motorcycles or clothing, sales tend to rise dramatically because young people, who are the target market, adore celebrities. Since owning these goods signifies their social standing, the quality is evidently of lesser concern.\nNevertheless, while it's true that advertisements can be misleading and exaggerated, it is equally valid that advertising plays a crucial role in the economy. They launch new products, offer a variety of options, and are often visually appealing, as their primary aim is to capture your attention. Advertising also contributes to maintaining competitive prices, fostering a fair business environment. Otherwise, the market might become monopolized, limiting both price and choice.\nWhile the influence of advertising may be exaggerated, it's undeniable that the ultimate decision rests with us as consumers.

{"id": "id_953", "input": "Over the years, the internet has grown increasingly popular, offering individuals a vast reservoir of information. Consequently, traditional print media like newspapers have seen a significant drop in readership. While some hold on to the belief that newspapers will persist for an extended period, others contest this, asserting that newspapers have lost their competitive edge to ensure their long-term survival. I personally lean towards the latter perspective for the following reasons.\nTo start with, accessing information via the internet is faster and more convenient than reading newspapers. Unlike in the past when individuals had to wait long hours for a daily newspaper, today they can receive the latest news updated every second through their smartphones or computers, anytime and anywhere. It is evident that these devices are widespread globally, facilitating access to a multitude of information that newspapers cannot cover in just a few pages. Therefore, print media has struggled to maintain its crucial role in delivering information.\nAdditionally, from a financial perspective, purchasing newspapers seems like a waste of money when internet access is available to everyone. It is obvious that internet services are offered at low costs or even free in many countries. The question is whether someone would spend extra money on newspapers to get the same, or often less, information than what is readily available online? The likely answer is that rational individuals would rarely do so. Consequently, the readership of newspapers may continue to decline sharply, potentially resulting in many shutting down in the near future.\nFurthermore, when considering the environment, it becomes clear that more newspaper production leads to more trees being cut down. This is a direct contributor to the deforestation occurring globally today. At this juncture, the production of newspapers will have to contend with environmentalists to remain viable.\nTo sum up, it might be disheartening for newspaper advocates to witness the potential disappearance of this medium.

From my perspective, role models within a household significantly impact the formation of a child's personality traits. For instance, in a typical Turkish family, while a mother provides warmth and thoughtfulness, a father's presence with authority and conservatism is essential for nurturing a well-mannered child.\nAnother reason I assert that fatherhood holds as much significance as motherhood is the evolving nature of relationships today. Personally, I think we live in a world where gender equality is emphasized in all areas of life, including within relationships. For example, the traditional family setup of a housewife caring for the home and children while the husband is the breadwinner is no longer prevalent.

Many strive to match the rapid pace of today's advancements. I am of the opinion that even if moving at a rapid pace might be a prudent approach to align with the modern world. Nonetheless, this might not be the most advantageous strategy for society as a whole.\nFirst and foremost, even in a fast-paced world, precision remains essential. Even mundane tasks like homework demand precision. Rushing through work, risking errors, means we make no real effort, merely completing tasks superficially to meet deadlines. In essence, this only accomplishes the task itself, which is of little value. Our focus should be on enhancing our work skills rather than simply aiming to complete tasks. Certainly it might take longer to match others if we need to repeatedly review our work, but with consistent effort, soon enough we'll be able to increase our work speed.\nIn addition, beyond the need for precision, the world also demands efficiency, which means timely completion and quality standards. Even if we manage to keep pace by overlooking project details and only focusing on the general framework, this won't satisfy the company and clients. We will soon be irrelevant, even if we keep pace because when issues arise, we'll have to go back and correct the mistakes. This could prove more costly and time-consuming than thorough initial work.\nMoreover, when we examine this issue in a broader context, Some tasks cannot afford any errors, for example, in critical missions, such as those undertaken by NASA, even a minor error can be disastrous. An error in calculating a rocket's orbit could doom an entire project worth trillions. In these scenarios, even though scientists may wish to expedite completion, they cannot afford to overlook any aspect of the mission, as it could lead to numerous issues.\nTo conclude, while it is crucial that we must keep pace with the world's speed, it is crucial for us to exercise extreme caution because sloppy work is unacceptable if we aim to remain competitive.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay314", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 211, "to": 292}], "label": "Claim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 307, "to": 378}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 400, "to": 455}], "label": "Claim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 457, "to": 506}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 508, "to": 631}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 645, "to": 709}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 711, "to": 803}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 815, "to": 892}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 898, "to": 974}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 989, "to": 1106}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1108, "to": 1256}], "label": "Claim", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1258, "to": 1306}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1315, "to": 1380}], "label": "Premise", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1382, "to": 1456}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1517, "to": 1552}], "label": "Claim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1567, "to": 1659}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1661, "to": 1746}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1768, "to": 1917}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1957, "to": 1997}], "label": "Claim", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1999, "to": 2047}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2056, "to": 2115}], "label": "Claim", "id": 20}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 7, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 10, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 10, 14, 18, 19, 20]}

The fact that numerous individuals own cars and rely on them regularly underscores their importance. Speaking broadly, I wholeheartedly concur with the notion that cars have enhanced the quality of contemporary life, for a variety of reasons.\nTo begin with, individuals can now traverse extensive distances swiftly, leading to numerous benefits. Take, for instance, relationships. A multitude of people can sustain relationships across vast distances because they can regularly visit one another by employing their automobile. Reflecting on my own experiences, I remember that my car has consistently facilitated frequent meetings with my childhood friends despite residing in a different city. I managed to form a relationship with someone living 89 kilometers away. Our car enabled us to meet on weekends, and we remain a happy couple today. Without my vehicle, developing a relationship would have been unlikely.\nMoreover, cars boost employment opportunities since people can commute to work and are able to work farther from home. Additionally, they enjoy greater flexibility. For instance, my father has consistently worked throughout Germany, which has increased his earnings. He drove his car to distant parts of the country, worked there during the week, and returned home for the weekends. Without his car, he wouldn't be able to reunite with his family on weekends, thus his vehicle is a significant asset both financially and socially.\nLastly, the automobile enables individuals to travel more frequently, thus allowing them to explore the world. without cars, individuals may spend most of their lives within their hometown or village. They predominantly rely on public transportation, which restricts access to certain areas.

Personally, I assert that students should consistently attend classes regardless of their exam results. \nTo begin with, when it comes to acquiring knowledge, being present in class is more beneficial than solitary studying aimed at exam success. Classes are meticulously crafted for learners, and professors undoubtedly possess greater knowledge than their students. Professors bring not only expertise but also a wealth of experience, enabling them to guide students towards academic success. \nFurthermore, it's a fundamental duty of students to attend their classes. Attending lectures is the most compelling way for students to demonstrate respect towards both their educators and themselves. A significant number of professors factor attendance into their grading. Put differently, class attendance is deemed as crucial as exam results. Even those who excel in exams may find themselves failing if they neglect attending classes.\nThere are those who contend that students may feel they have grasped the class material sufficiently to excel in exams, or they might prefer self-study. Why spend time in class when self-study could be more productive? Yet, I contend that this reflects an overly self-assured perspective. I am convinced that professors invariably offer insights beyond what students can achieve independently due to their experience and credentials. Additionally, even if students believe they're capable of surpassing their instructors, attending class allows for engaging discussions with professors and peers. \nTo summarize, students can gain a deeper understanding and express respect for their professors and themselves by attending classes.

Nonetheless, when we delve into the debate surrounding competition versus cooperation, our primary focus shifts from societal advancement to the holistic development of an individual\u2019s life. From this perspective, I strongly advocate that greater emphasis should be placed on fostering cooperation during early education.\nTo begin with, cooperation enables children to develop interpersonal skills that are crucial throughout their lives. Engaging in teamwork teaches us not only how to achieve shared goals but, more importantly, how to build relationships and work harmoniously with others. Through cooperative activities, children gain the ability to listen to others' viewpoints, communicate effectively, think holistically, and even negotiate or compromise when disagreements arise. These interpersonal skills contribute to forming positive relationships and have a lifelong impact on their ability to interact with others.\nOn the flip side, the primary value of competition lies in pushing individuals to strive for excellence in order to achieve success. This is why it is frequently argued that competition drives efficiency and productivity within society. However, when reflecting on the strategies needed to secure victory, it becomes evident that collaboration plays a vital role. The loftier our aspirations, the greater the need for competition. Consider the Olympic Games, a prime example of competition\u2014an athlete's success is inconceivable without the guidance of their coach, the support of nutritionists, and the care provided by medical professionals. While the athlete earns the title, the victory is a testament to the collective effort of the entire team.

Personally, I am convinced that online classes should never replace classroom learning. Here are my reasons.\nFirstly, it's clear that classroom learning is the most effective method of delivering education compared to online classes. Within a classroom setting, you have the opportunity to learn from your peers, since Observing classmates who excel can motivate you to enhance your own performance. To illustrate, During my first year in B Com, I was not focused on my studies; however, seeing friends achieve higher grades inspired me to improve my own academic performance. Ultimately, I achieved the top rank in the final exams.\nSecondly, Classroom learning requires you to complete assignments promptly. This enhances your time management skills. Additionally, Engaging in group study sessions teaches you how to effectively communicate with others. Improved communication and teamwork skills benefit your future career.\nThirdly, Professors are crucial in the classroom learning process, as they are experts in their fields, providing valuable insights and skills. Working under a professor allows you to ask questions directly, helping to clarify any uncertainties. Consequently, learning occurs more rapidly. For instance, I have firsthand experience.

Familiarity with other countries and their languages broadens a child's worldview. Hence, they can enhance their personal development and self-reliance. \nOverall, it is simple to notice the difference between a bilingual child and one who speaks only their native tongue when assessing their communication skills, comprehension of various subjects, etc., which explains why children should begin learning a foreign language at the start of their education.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay327", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 221, "to": 313}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 315, "to": 445}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 457, "to": 559}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 575, "to": 703}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 705, "to": 774}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 789, "to": 886}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1022, "to": 1069}], "label": "Claim", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1084, "to": 1170}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1172, "to": 1226}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1242, "to": 1325}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1327, "to": 1408}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1417, "to": 1478}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1490, "to": 1680}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1701, "to": 1782}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 13}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 6, 11, 12, 13]}

In certain countries, teenagers have the chance to engage in part-time work alongside their studies. Nevertheless, some individuals oppose the idea of teenagers working while studying. Personally, it is beneficial for teenagers to take on part-time jobs while still being students, and I have two reasons to support this viewpoint.\nThe primary reason is that students can acquire numerous skills from part-time work before entering their actual careers. They can learn about managing time, handling finances, and persuading others through communication. To illustrate, During my high school years, I worked for a year as a salesperson in a store. Since I needed to allocate some of my time to my job, hence I had to efficiently organize my time. Balancing my boss's expectations with completing my homework was necessary. This experience taught me effective time management and the ability to perform tasks swiftly and efficiently. Furthermore, I learned how to handle finances. Whenever my boss was absent, I had to oversee the shop's accounting section. Through this, I grasped the principles of managing money correctly. This experience demonstrated that part-time work can impart valuable lessons to students.\nAnother reason is that students can earn money from part-time jobs, providing financial support to their families. For instance, during my time in high school, I worked as a private tutor, teaching math to two children from my neighborhood. I assisted them in grasping complex book topics. By earning money from tutoring, I was able to purchase books for myself. On top of that, After accepting that part-time job, I ceased to ask my parents for pocket money. Clearly, Part-time employment can enable students to earn money, aiding their families financially.\nIn conclusion, I am certain some individuals will oppose the notion of part-time jobs for students. They might contend, it can distract students from their studies. However, as I undertook a part-time job during high school, and it did not adversely affect my academic performance, I firmly believe part-time work is advantageous for students.

{"id": "id_964", "input": "The conservation of wild animals within zoos is a topic that often sparks intense discussion. Advocates argue that wildlife receives expert care, while critics assert that confinement in zoos strips animals of their freedom. Personally, wild animals should inhabit their natural environments rather than zoos.\nFirstly, wild creatures are entitled to exist in spaces free from human interference. Considering that humans are accountable for significant pollution and destruction of the habitats of numerous wild animals, we are obligated to establish a natural and secure environment for animals. Clearly, the confined areas with artificial foliage and water bodies cannot truly compensate for what animals lose. Furthermore, prolonged confinement of rural animals in zoos adversely affects their physical and emotional well-being. Consequently, wild creatures face risks of loneliness and sadness. It appears that zoos tend to act more as destroyers than saviors in the preservation of wildlife.\nOn the other hand, proponents might assert that zoos, outfitted with modern amenities and skilled professionals, can offer superior care to the animals within.

A hotly debated topic today is whether the government should bear the responsibility for providing healthcare and education to its citizens.\nSome individuals maintain that the government is obligated to financially support citizens' healthcare and education. The rationale behind this is citizens are entitled to live in a peaceful and stable environment, which the government, as society's leader, should provide. Without access to healthcare and education, citizens' physical and mental well-being would be compromised. Consequently, such individuals may not receive timely medical treatment, negatively impacting their work efficiency, thereby affecting industrial productivity. Additionally, lacking adequate educational guidance, these citizens might exhibit misconduct or resort to crime, endangering the safety of others. Thus, the government must take responsibility for citizens' healthcare and education to ensure societal safety and stability.\nConversely, there are those who argue against this viewpoint, asserting subsidizing healthcare and education for every citizen is an inefficient use of public funds, because many individuals already possess the means to finance these services independently. They propose instead that the government should prioritize urgent issues impacting public welfare, such as the rising crime rate, the AIDS epidemic, or infrastructure deficits, which demand government funding for resolution.\nIn my view, the government ought to support the underprivileged in obtaining healthcare and education, as they are the ones genuinely in need of governmental assistance.

Personally, I fully support this idea because it offers benefits to multiple parties, as I will explain further.\nPrimarily, I contend that having access to the defendant's past records would simplify the decision-making process for juries. This is due to the fact that a thorough understanding of the defendant's background allows juries to assess the crime more effectively before delivering a judgment. Consider, for example, consider an individual who has never committed murder but is suddenly found guilty. knowing the individual's history enables juries to determine whether the crime was committed deliberately or under specific circumstances. Consequently, the punishment can then be tailored according to the situation.\nMoreover, this approach ensures a more equitable trial. As we are all aware, juries consist of individuals who typically possess limited legal knowledge. Therefore, providing them with the defendant's past records enables them to think more logically and piece together a more meaningful verdict. In doing this, juries will feel reassured that their conclusion is based on substantial evidence. Additionally, the accused will also undergo a fair process.\nIt is indisputable that when the defendant's background is thoroughly investigated and revealed to the public, their privacy is compromised. should they be found innocent, they might feel humiliated facing society.

Some individuals argue that broad knowledge enhances the likelihood of success, whereas others believe that expertise in a specific area is crucial for achieving success. Both perspectives seem reasonable and compelling. Personally, possessing a wide range of knowledge is essential for achieving success. The following elaborates on my viewpoint.\nTo begin with, being familiar with various regions' work facilitates making friends more easily. For instance, I was employed by a large corporation with numerous departments, including the Management Information System department where I worked. Our daily task was to address the issues raised by clients over the phone. Despite some issues belonging to the Engineering department, I visited and engaged in discussions with colleagues there, because I had taken several engineering courses. This made communication simpler for me than for anyone else in my department, boosting my popularity and easing the process of receiving assistance.\nFurthermore, understanding various fields is crucial when transitioning between majors. Consider my cousin Jeff and his friend as an illustration. They studied finance during their college years. However, post-graduation, they opted to pursue careers in the art industry. Through Jeff's diligent efforts in his spare time, he acquired substantial knowledge about art history. Ultimately, he became part of an excellent team, whereas his friend, solely knowledgeable in finance, had no choice but to work in a bank.\nAlthough I concur with the notion that understanding various fields is vital, I must acknowledge opposing views. Some may contend that if one cannot succeed in their own major, what can they achieve in other fields. While there might be some truth to this argument, what if someone discovers they have talent in another area. Consequently, it won't pose any challenge.\nIn summary, considering the aforementioned reasons, when weighing the pros and cons of acquiring knowledge across different domains, the optimal choice clearly aligns with my stance: having extensive knowledge across various subjects is indeed crucial.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay263", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 390, "to": 461}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 520, "to": 600}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 827, "to": 946}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 956, "to": 995}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 997, "to": 1144}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1159, "to": 1232}], "label": "Claim", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1418, "to": 1520}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1522, "to": 1659}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1796, "to": 1875}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1927, "to": 1985}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2213, "to": 2281}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 10}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 1, 5, 8, 10]}

They maintain that teachers instill foundational skills like writing, reading, and arithmetic from an early age in kindergarten. And as they progress to primary school, educators impart advanced knowledge, such as writing proficiency and computer literacy. It is the teachers who assist them in overcoming educational challenges. Conversely, students primarily acquire their knowledge through teachers, who also guide them in understanding moral distinctions.\nOn the flip side, those who argue students gain significantly more insight from alternative sources like the Internet and television strongly believe these platforms offer students a wealth of information that is not typically covered in classroom settings. They can simply enter keywords into a search engine, leading to a plethora of articles and websites on the subject. As a result, students find it effortless to acquire knowledge. Additionally, they assert that quality television programs can be educational for students. For example, Discovery Channel features numerous educational episodes.

Nonetheless, I believe that games are not as crucial for them anymore for several reasons.\nThe first reason is that games lose their necessity for individuals once their careers commence. Some might contend that games aid adults in unwinding and achieving a balanced life. However, frequently, work pressure and family obligations compel them to give up their lifelong pastimes, and consequently, they cannot dedicate the same time and energy to their favorite games as they did 15 or 20 years ago. For instance, in my country, aside from a small group of professional athletes, most people cease to play games seriously once they secure a good job. They often perceive these games as more of a hassle than a pleasure in their everyday lives.\nAnother point worth noting is that adults typically do not engage in games as competitive activities, unlike children who are always eager to compete and win. For children, maintaining a winning spirit often fosters many remarkable traits, regardless of whether they engage in sports events. For example, my younger sister enjoys fencing, and her determination to win ensures she never gives up, even when faced with challenges or injury. Conversely, adults often dismiss such behavior as immature and abandon it quickly. Indeed, a person with a strong competitive streak often struggles to collaborate with peers and colleagues. Consequently, they no longer engage in games for modest achievements, eventually losing interest in these activities.\nIn conclusion, I believe adults do require games, but their approach differs from children's, being generally less competitive and more for enjoyment.

In the past, students who were weary of commuting had no choice but to attend nearby schools, regardless of differences in teaching facilities, teacher qualifications, or school reputation.

They argue that traditional teaching methods, which include student discussions and teamwork, are crucial to the campus experience.

{"id": "id_981", "input": "With the rise in democratic awareness in recent times, individuals are increasingly concerned about the allocation of tax funds by the government. Consequently, some propose channeling tax revenue towards services that benefit the public rather than the arts. However, in my opinion, I assert that arts should also be a part of the government's investment portfolio.\nCertainly, the government ought to prioritize public services and infrastructure. This is due to the fact that the government acts as a guiding force among citizens, tasked with responsibly utilizing tax funds to ensure societal safety and stability. Moreover, public services, including the education system and healthcare, fulfill people's fundamental needs for survival, safety, and knowledge, fostering comfort and potentially reducing crime rates. Hence, it is crucial for the authorities to adequately fund public services and infrastructure to uphold societal stability.\nConversely, I contend that the government must not overlook the importance of arts. Personally, arts have the capacity to enhance individuals' cultural experiences. Nowadays, people are increasingly consumed by their work and studies due to intense competition. As a result, they need diverse forms of entertainment like music, movies, or literature to relax and alleviate stress. Absence of arts may lead to an increased risk of psychological issues among people.\nFrom a community perspective, investing in arts positively impacts local cultural and economic growth. Cultural heritage is a significant aspect of the arts. This implies preserving local arts can aid in safeguarding local cultural heritage, fostering a sense of belonging among residents and boosting the local tourism sector. In this context, arts fulfill both cultural and economic roles.\nConsidering these arguments, I would assert that public services and infrastructure are essential components of government spending.

{"id": "id_982", "input": "Nowadays, an increasing number of university educators are engaging in scientific research. Some people worry that this might lead to a deterioration in the quality of education and recommend that professors invest more effort in teaching. Nonetheless, based on my experiences, professors should be encouraged to focus primarily on research activities.\nTo begin with, engaging in research serves as a means of self-enhancement for professors. Universities provide a relatively enclosed environment. Research initiatives enable interaction with the external world. Furthermore, through research, educators can stay abreast of the latest advancements in technology. I vividly recall my professor being involved in numerous research projects during my college years. He was frequently invited to deliver lectures at other academic institutions. Despite the fact that my university wasn't highly ranked, yet he achieved recognition through these projects. These research projects act as portals to a broader world.\nMoreover, professors ought to fully capitalize on the research-conducive atmosphere that universities offer. State-of-the-art laboratories are a common sight on campuses. Additionally, It's rare to find another place where so many talented individuals gather. As a result, It would be unwise to deter professors from utilizing these advantages. It's widely known that Einstein formulated the theory of general relativity while teaching at HU Berlin. Universities significantly contribute to the success of educators. \nFinally, engaging in research can enhance the quality of teaching. Research projects enable educators to bridge the gap between classroom learning and real-world applications. They can effectively teach students how to apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios. I fondly recall assisting in one of my professor's research endeavors. Participating in it allowed me to apply textbook theories in real-life experiments. Research projects offer a more effective approach to teaching. \nFor these reasons, it makes perfect sense to advocate for professors dedicating more time to research activities.

This urge is often nurtured by schools and parents who encourage them to achieve top grades through the grading system.. Although a child who is competitive is typically more eager to pursue goals and tackle challenges independently, there is a risk of children becoming overly competitive, hindering their ability to collaborate with others. While being competitive can lead to success, it can also limit their growth in various aspects. For instance, a highly competitive individual might struggle to navigate or contribute effectively in a team-oriented project.\nConversely, cooperation is a crucial trait for children, both in school settings and within communities. Possessing a strong cooperative spirit enables children to communicate better and establish connections, which enhances their ability to solve problems and achieve goals efficiently through teamwork. Ultimately, in society, significant achievements are rarely attained by individuals working in isolation. For example, famous singers or movie stars, despite their individual talents, always have a team to manage tasks and handle various responsibilities.\nFrom my perspective, while a competitive children tend to have more drive and vision, which can lead them to success, this trait may not be as beneficial once they enter a workplace or society that demands strong teamwork skills.

As a result of globalization, many individuals are traveling for business purposes. Therefore, using a single language will alleviate challenges that travelers face in routine activities such as ordering meals or navigating new locations. Moreover, students relocating for superior educational opportunities would experience less stress since they can easily form new friendships and participate in discussions which might otherwise be challenging in a multilingual environment; this facilitates smoother adaptation to new settings. A single language also minimizes misunderstandings between individuals. In addition, sharing knowledge across various fields of research such as electronics, medicine, and astronomy would become more straightforward.\nIn contrast, some people are concerned about the diminishing local languages. These languages serve as the foundation for the emergence and initial communication among different cultures. They embody regional culture. As these languages see reduced usage, cultural elements evolve alongside. Additionally, these languages are deeply intertwined with history; ancient literature and inscriptions will become indecipherable if these languages vanish.\nIn conclusion, I am of the opinion that change is unavoidable and the adoption of a single language globally is a favorable one.

I wholeheartedly support the notion that governments should allocate a larger share of their health budgets towards health education and preventive measures.\nThe primary reason for increasing funding for education and preventative measures is the potential enhancement of the healthcare system. I hold the view that reducing the number of patients within the healthcare system can lead to more efficient management of hospitals and healthcare centers, resulting in improved treatments for existing patients. Consequently, it is essential for society to be informed and cognizant of health-related issues so that proactive steps to prevent illnesses can be taken instead of merely addressing the rising number of patients.\nAnother reason for governments to prioritize funding for illness prevention and health education is the overall well-being of the community. From my perspective, nothing is more critical than health in an individual's life, and happiness and well-being are intertwined with good health. Hence, the government's responsibility should be to provide resources that enable its citizens to learn how to avoid potential illnesses that could lead to suffering. For instance, the Ministry of Health in Turkey's campaign targeting youth smoking issues enhanced the well-being of those who stopped smoking and embraced a healthier lifestyle post-campaign.\nTo sum up, a larger portion of the budget should be dedicated to education and prevention over treatment to achieve a more efficient healthcare system and enhanced well-being.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay171", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 194, "to": 309}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 469, "to": 659}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 675, "to": 756}], "label": "Claim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 765, "to": 873}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1037, "to": 1160}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1169, "to": 1327}], "label": "Claim", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1343, "to": 1519}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1532, "to": 1695}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 7}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 2, 5, 7]}

Some individuals believe that pets should be regarded as family members, yet others contend that they are merely animals incapable of human-like thought. This debate is contentious, but I believe pets should be treated like human beings for a variety of reasons.\nTo begin with, pets are our companions just as some humans are. Much like friends, they are constantly by our side and offer companionship when we feel isolated. We can communicate with them because they listen to us more attentively than many people ever do. To demonstrate this, I can share a personal incident. When I was 14, my uncle passed away, leaving me feeling that nothing mattered anymore. Conversations with my friends proved to be frustrating because none of them had ever experienced something similar. Given that I was home alone for an extended period, my dog stayed by my side, and it felt as if he was the only one who truly understood my profound emotions. Without a doubt, although pets cannot verbally communicate with us, we can nevertheless rely on them.\nFurthermore, pets serve a multitude of purposes. For instance, pet therapy is becoming increasingly prevalent today. Studies have shown that pets can provide benefits for numerous health conditions. There are dogs trained to guide visually impaired individuals throughout the city and consequently without them, navigating independently would be impossible. Additionally, pets are also crucial for people dealing with depression because their presence provides comfort and enhances wellbeing. Moreover, there are dogs specifically trained to detect criminals or use their keen sense of smell to locate drugs.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that pets deserve to be treated like family members due to all the reasons previously mentioned, particularly they are our friends and they can be beneficial in various situations.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay313", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 357, "to": 397}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 439, "to": 486}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 488, "to": 584}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 586, "to": 614}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 623, "to": 682}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 738, "to": 823}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 825, "to": 879}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 888, "to": 939}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 952, "to": 991}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 993, "to": 1098}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1126, "to": 1166}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1168, "to": 1200}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1215, "to": 1249}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1265, "to": 1317}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1319, "to": 1399}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1401, "to": 1482}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1500, "to": 1558}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1574, "to": 1630}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1639, "to": 1693}], "label": "Premise", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1705, "to": 1809}], "label": "Premise", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1848, "to": 1894}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 20}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1953, "to": 2022}], "label": "Claim", "id": 21}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 10, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 19, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 16, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 17, "target": 18, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 12, 20, 21]}

{"id": "id_994", "input": "In recent decades, advancements in technology and globalization have significantly accelerated the pace of life. While most individuals are caught up in this fast-paced lifestyle, some choose to slow down and savor life. To form a comprehensive understanding, it's essential to weigh both the pros and cons of this increased speed of life and consider which lifestyle is more beneficial. I believe that it is crucial to embrace a slower pace of living, because there are numerous drawbacks to constantly rushing through life.\nFirstly, a hectic lifestyle is highly stressful and can negatively impact your health. Continuous rush without taking breaks can lead to adverse physical reactions due to stress. A lot of diligent individuals suffer from conditions like burnout syndrome, because their bodies can't keep up with the demanding pace. For example, my father experienced a breakdown some years back because of his high-pressure job. After taking several weeks off, he recovered, and now, with a slower lifestyle, he is doing well.\nMoreover, slowing down in life can boost your happiness. Constantly dealing with excessive stress makes it difficult to attend to loved ones. By not rushing, you can devote more time to family and friends. Nurturing your social connections enhances your happiness and lowers stress levels. For instance, I have a friend who lives at a leisurely pace and is very content with it, because he is able to relish family moments and maintain his friendships.\nLastly, producing quality outcomes requires adequate time.

While some may argue that such international tourism adversely impacts host countries, I assert that it has spurred economic growth and has helped preserve the cultural and environmental integrity of tourist destinations. \nTo begin with, international tourism enhances various sectors of the host country's economy to cater to the diverse needs of travelers. Consider Cambodia, where the influx of visitors to the ancient Angkor Wat temple necessitates services such as eateries, accommodations, souvenir shops, and other retail outlets. These requirements stimulate local businesses, leading to job creation for residents and improvements in infrastructure and living conditions. Consequently, tourism has evidently enhanced the quality of life in the host country.\nFurthermore, the tourism sector has played a key role in preserving cultural heritage and safeguarding natural environments. For example, In Vietnam, cultural practices and natural landmarks, such as the 'Trong Dong' drum performance and 'Ha Long' Bay, receive encouragement and financial backing from the tourism ministry. Absent this support and revenue from tourism, many traditional cultures might vanish due to their low economic viability. Therefore, tourism has preserved numerous intangible cultural values and picturesque landscapes. \nIn conclusion, from my perspective, international tourism has fostered economic progress while upholding cultural and environmental values in host countries.

{"id": "id_996", "input": "In current times, an increasing number of individuals opt for ready-made meals as their regular diet because it allows people to save time, which is equated with money in today's society. Nonetheless, it is evident that ready-made meals can have adverse effects due to the use of artificial additives, neglecting nutrition, and altering eating habits. In this essay, I aim to illustrate why this trend is unfavorable based on the aforementioned three reasons.\nTo begin with, to simplify preparation and enhance flavor, nearly every manufacturer incorporates various artificial additives into the food most people now purchase. Several these additives have led to severe consequences. For example, often, there are articles in newspapers and magazines discussing the link between certain chemical components in foods and illnesses. Therefore, conveniently prepared meals can occasionally pose health risks.\nNeglecting to cook fresh food can result in nutritional deficiencies. While it's true that preparing ready-made meals requires significantly less time than cooking fresh dishes. On the other hand, some studies have clearly shown that ready-made meals fail to provide the necessary nutrients, particularly for children who are in developmental stages.\nMoreover, cooking represents one of the artistic expressions humans have crafted. The more we consume ready-made meals, the more we lose our culinary skills. With the increasing pace of life, many people rely solely on microwaves to prepare dishes within five minutes. However, few people recognize that this change has altered cooking habits, potentially eroding our culinary customs and traditions.\nIn summary, even though the creation of ready-made meals undeniably meets the needs of those with busy work schedules, this is not a positive development.

{"id": "id_997", "input": "Regarding whether classmates or coworkers should collaborate on projects face-to-face or through email, I believe that working face-to-face is more favorable due to it facilitates effective communication. \nTo begin with, team members might hold diverse perspectives and need to efficiently unify their opinions. Clearly, engaging in face-to-face discussion during meetings is far superior to email communication. Furthermore, Beijing University conducted an experiment involving two groups discussing an activity budget. The initial group had in-person discussions, whereas the second group communicated via email. The findings indicate that the first group achieved consensus on the budget within 30 minutes, whereas the latter took 30 hours. Similar experiments by other researchers confirm that quick consensus is reached through direct conversation. \nIn addition, face-to-face collaboration can indirectly boost project quality and efficiency because it minimizes the chances of conflicts or disputes among team members. Drafting an email for an informal issue can make it appear formal, consequently recipients may feel anxious or possibly offended by the written tone. Whereas when the same words are spoken, the listener tends to feel at ease since their reactions aren't recorded, preventing misinterpretation of informal talks as formal statements. Thus, reduced misunderstandings lead to fewer disputes and enhance team communication. \nThough it's true that email is sometimes necessary when team members are geographically dispersed. Even though while emails aren't ideal for collaboration, they are preferable to having no communication. Considering for classroom or campus projects, it's unlikely that participants are spread across different locations. \nMoreover, it is important to recognize that project coordination involves numerous tasks, and relying solely on email can lead to an overwhelming volume of messages, which is not a pleasant experience.

The reality is that harmful bacteria and pathogens in polluted water can enter human bodies indirectly, causing severe health complications, potentially fatal if not addressed promptly. \nFurthermore, there is a high probability that much of the food available in large cities is unsafe for consumption. Recent studies indicate that toxic food products are commonly found in today's marketplaces.

In addition, residing in these cities also equates to living in areas with high crime rates.

{"id": "id_999", "input": "Modern society is characterized by intense competition. While some argue that fostering a cooperative mindset in children is crucial, others assert that competition is the key to success. Yet, adopting a cooperative approach consistently guides children to grow into responsible adults with strong moral values and a supportive social network. Collaboration is vital for effective teamwork. Educational institutions focus on promoting a cooperative mindset among students. Living in a community, mutual assistance and sharing are pathways to success. No one can achieve or learn everything alone. For example, lions hunt collaboratively. Their ability to catch prey and simplify the task is due to teamwork. Similarly, A cooperative approach conserves time and energy while increasing success rates. Nonetheless, Cooperation aids in understanding different viewpoints and learning from others' mistakes. It helps individuals recognize their strengths and weaknesses compared to others. Collaborative efforts can inspire and motivate by observing others' successes. However, competition holds equal significance as cooperation. Sadly, the concept of competition has been twisted in an unfavorable way. A person should focus on competing with themselves rather than trying to surpass others. Competition has driven progress in science and technology. Competition fosters improvement and advancement. For instance, Every day, companies develop new cars that outperform others in efficiency. Such competition provides consumers with a wider array of choices. However, self-serving and reckless competition is harmful. A 'your loss, my gain' attitude in competition is unsustainable over time. Competition should always be centered on self-betterment. The best form of competition is one that involves surpassing one's own limits. In conclusion, both competition and cooperation are inseparable facets of the same coin.

Artistic creations contribute to raising social awareness by delivering social messages.\nNevertheless, Innovative works encourage individuals to reflect peacefully and examine their own consciences. They help bring attention to issues and criticize government misconduct. For example, Bangladeshi writer Taslima Nasrin faced accusations of opposing the government simply because she highlighted a social issue. Such an approach hinders the nurturing of creative talents. Furthermore, Creativity also offers aesthetic appeal.\nRegrettably, many governments place constraints on artists. Frank Zappa once remarked, \"A mind is like a parachute, it doesn\u2019t function unless it\u2019s open\". Imposing restrictions will only stifle artists' innovative ideas and confine their creativity. Artists, like the media, should have the freedom to express their ideas openly.\nHowever, Artists must also be mindful not to offend people's sentiments.

{"id": "id_514", "input": "The disparity in earnings among people can sometimes be unjust. In the realm of art, contemporary artists might earn substantial amounts for their creations, whereas laborers might toil for years to achieve a comparable income. While some argue that the government should intervene to address this inequity, others oppose this stance. I agree that in this case, it is not within the government's purview to intervene.\nSkill and expertise lead to excellence in art. It is evident that modern artists who channel their innovative ideas into high-value creations are compensated generously by art collectors. Furthermore, the substantial earnings of contemporary artists are attributed to the quality and rarity of their talent, rather than the quantity. For instance, a handcrafted 15-centimeter Buddha temple is valued significantly more than mass-produced versions. Conversely, modern artists invest effort into discovering unique concepts that ordinary individuals cannot conceive, effectively transforming the impossible into possible. Pieter Padang, the creator of Minions, ingeniously altered the lyrics of the song \"I swear\" to \"underwear\" for the Minions' performance in Despicable Me. He received substantial financial rewards for this creative idea.\nIn stark contrast, factory workers producing merchandise earn mere pennies even though they craft hundreds of 15 cm Buddha temples daily.

This trait is often cultivated in school, where teachers encourage students to adopt a more competitive spirit through grading systems, prompting children to strive for the highest scores. This attribute paves the way for their future success, but it can also limit them in various ways.

{"id": "id_712", "input": "The question of whether the use of machines brings significant advantages to society is a matter of considerable debate. In my view, while machines offer numerous advantages, their potential downsides cannot be overlooked.\nThere is no doubt that machines provide a wide range of benefits. First of all, machines are more efficient compared to humans. Unlike humans, machines do not require rest, allowing them to operate continuously, delivering consistent and error-free production. Additionally, employing machines can significantly reduce business expenses. Since machines do not demand salaries, overtime pay, or retirement benefits, it follows that employers can avoid spending on employee benefits. Companies only require a few technicians to ensure machines run properly or to repair and replace parts when necessary. \nOn the other hand, it is essential not to disregard the drawbacks that machines bring. To begin with, the widespread use of machines has resulted in job losses for many individuals. This is particularly concerning in countries with large populations, where high unemployment rates can lead to increased crime and social unrest. Moreover, the use of machines also contributes to serious environmental pollution and excessive energy consumption. For instance, these days, people often prefer using dishwashers over washing dishes by hand. However, they may not realize that dishwashers consume at least twice as much water and electricity compared to handwashing.
