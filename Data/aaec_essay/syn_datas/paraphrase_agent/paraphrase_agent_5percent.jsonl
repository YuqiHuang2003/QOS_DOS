{"id": "id_0", "input": "I believe that it is not advisable for teenagers to work while they are students. While some contend that many believe it offers valuable work experience, I maintain that it can disrupt their lives in multiple ways. Holding a job could negatively impact a student's health. It shifts their focus away from academics and strips away their youthful years.\nIn today's competitive environment, students must study extensively to prove themselves. They need to dedicate most of their time to school to achieve high grades. If they spend their remaining time working, it imposes additional stress on them. Moreover, Jobs come with various duties such as attendance, occasionally extra tasks, and more. This leads to stress, anxiety, and exhaustion. They won't have adequate time for rest and sleep. Consequently, potentially harming their mental and physical well-being.\nAdditionally, jobs can distract students from their academic pursuits. Early exposure to earning money can lead students to become fixated on financial gain. They start feeling self-sufficient and choose to work more for money. This detracts from their studies, causing a loss of interest in academics. Furthermore, leading them to abandon their education in pursuit of greater earnings.\nBesides, The significant downside to teenage employment is missing out on the joys of childhood. They miss out on activities like socializing with friends, club involvement, and other enjoyable and social experiences. They have their entire lives ahead to work and achieve success, but their childhood years are irreplaceable. Hence, they should seize life's opportunities as much as they can.\nThus, it is crucial for teenagers to prioritize their education.

{"id": "id_1", "input": "Nowadays, closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras are extensively utilized across various settings. They are employed in educational institutions, commercial enterprises, and other locations to oversee ongoing activities. There's no denying that CCTV offers a multitude of advantages, particularly in curbing criminal activities and safeguarding employees within a premise. Despite this, some contend that these cameras infringe on their privacy due to continuous surveillance. Nonetheless, I am firmly convinced that CCTV cameras ought to be installed in all premises to tackle the increasing theft rates and ensure the safety of employees at work.\nTo begin with, having CCTV cameras in workplaces can lead to a reduction in crimes such as theft. This is owing to the fact that if a store is targeted by criminals, footage from these cameras can serve as evidence to track down the perpetrators. For instance, in Malaysia, law enforcement utilized CCTV footage to locate and apprehend a gang of thieves who broke into a Seven Eleven shop late at night. Moreover, employees, aware of being under constant watch, are less inclined to commit theft from the store. Hence, it is evident that CCTVs should be installed in all workplaces to decrease crime rates.\nAdditionally, in some offices, staff members often have to manage irate or upset customers. Occasionally, direct interactions with a displeased customer can pose physical threats to the employee. Consequently, having CCTV cameras installed can help employees navigate such situations because customers are well-aware that their interactions are being recorded. In the event of a dispute, video recordings can be used to establish what happened, allowing for further action. In summary, these cameras can offer a measure of protection to workers from customers.\nConsidering another viewpoint, the deployment of CCTV cameras does stir debate. Critics of CCTV systems argue that their privacy is compromised due to persistent surveillance. However, it's crucial to understand that safety is a priority over privacy, and prevention is preferable to dealing with potential consequences. Therefore, opponents of this system should strive to comprehend the circumstances and take proactive steps to avoid becoming crime victims.\nIn conclusion, CCTV cameras are indispensable and should be installed in all premises. This is primarily to protect against potential harm from intruders or thieves. It is true that the use of these cameras does result in a loss of privacy. Nevertheless, prioritizing safety is essential to ensure protection.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay085", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 519, "to": 649}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 666, "to": 747}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 780, "to": 896}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 912, "to": 1053}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1065, "to": 1161}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1189, "to": 1256}], "label": "Claim", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1272, "to": 1348}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1364, "to": 1452}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1468, "to": 1541}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1550, "to": 1617}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1646, "to": 1730}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1744, "to": 1817}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1899, "to": 1993}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2004, "to": 2138}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2151, "to": 2278}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2295, "to": 2365}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2367, "to": 2444}], "label": "Claim", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2462, "to": 2519}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2535, "to": 2588}], "label": "Premise", "id": 18}], "edges": [{"source": 5, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 16, "target": 17, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 17, "target": 18, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 5, 11, 12, 15, 16]}

From my perspective, while the protection of endangered species is significant, it is crucial that the needs of humans should be prioritized.\nTo begin with, the population is rising continuously, which means that the demand for food among humans is also rising. Farmland is essential for cultivating crops like wheat and corn, and it is clear that people cannot survive for more than a few weeks without food. Hence, farmlands are essential for human survival.\nAdditionally, shelters are necessary for protection against elements like wind, floods, and wild animals, indicating that land is required for people to construct homes. Having a place to live is an undeniable human necessity, second only to food.\nLastly, humans require several essential items to sustain life, many of which are industrial, such as pharmaceuticals. As a result, certain areas must be designated for industrial purposes. Modern life presents challenges that are eased by industrial advancements. \nIn summary, the population of endangered species is far smaller than that of humans, implying that they do not require as much land as humans do.

In my view, wealthy nations, as the fortunate few, have every obligation to distribute their wealth to aid the less fortunate.\nFrom an ethical standpoint, it is heartless to ignore the struggles against hunger and poverty faced by others, especially when offering help requires minimal effort from the observer. Compassion, a principle endorsed by nearly all religions, from Buddhism to Islam, sets us apart from animals.\nFrom an economic perspective, providing such assistance can result in a mutually beneficial scenario. There is no doubt that underdeveloped countries directly benefit from these actions. For developed nations, new health challenges may emerge from their efforts in underdeveloped regions; hence relevant research is then undertaken to address these challenges, advancing the pharmaceutical industry. The potential market in these impoverished countries, many of which have large populations, is also noteworthy. By nurturing positive relations with them, affluent countries can expand their global market and enhance future international trade. In return, these underdeveloped nations may offer discounted exports of local agricultural and mineral products, boosting each other's economies.\nIn conclusion, the assistance provided by wealthy nations is not only a moral obligation but also a strategic investment that will eventually yield returns.

Students gain insights from various sources like personal experiences, libraries, and interactions with others. I believe that attending lectures should be a matter of choice for students for the following reasons.\nFirstly, one argument against mandating class attendance for university students is that university students often learn more effectively from resources outside the classroom. Students have the option to study independently in the library, concentrating on the topics they find challenging. For instance, I have a close friend who was in the same department as me during our university years. She was able to grasp class content swiftly and comprehensively. Therefore, she seldom attended lectures and instead devoted her time to mastering difficult subjects. Ultimately, she graduated with excellent grades.\nSecondly, students should not be compelled to attend lectures because they can allocate the time spent in classes to other beneficial activities if they have a strong grasp of the class material. In my own experience, there were numerous occasions when I skipped biology classes because my university did not enforce class attendance. Additionally, I had preemptively covered all biology topics before enrolling in university. Consequently, I used the time from biology classes to work on my Chemistry research, achieving an A+ in both biology and chemistry. \nIn conclusion, I hold that students should be adept at choosing the right activities at the right time and efficiently managing their study schedules.

This approach can broaden your experiences, help uncover aspects of your personality, and reveal hidden talents. Nevertheless, this ideal isn't always achievable. If it fails, you might miss out on opportunities to excel in other areas. Thus, I firmly assert that you should concentrate on your strengths.\nConcentrating on your strengths aids in achieving your objectives. Undoubtedly, the more you focus on your strengths, the higher your chances of achieving greatness. For example, Albert Einstein, one of history's most proficient physicists, dedicated his life to advancing physics theories, ultimately formulating the special and general relativity. Instead, he paid little attention to other matters. It's reported that he surprisingly couldn't differentiate between hand soap and facial soap because, for him at least, properly using two different soaps was rather bothersome. As illustrated by the example above, focusing on your strengths increases your likelihood of achieving your goals.\nContinuing to excel at what you already do well can enhance your proficiency.

{"id": "id_9", "input": "In many countries, artists are granted the liberty to articulate their thoughts through their work. However, some suggest that governmental constraints are necessary to curb their expressions. Personally, I concur with this notion only to a limited degree and assert that artists should be allowed the freedom to create, leading to the creation of exceptional masterpieces.\nPrimarily, if there is regulation over artists' expressions, their creative spark will undoubtedly diminish over time. It is indisputable that when given the chance to express themselves, most artists will think creatively and produce remarkable works like paintings or films. For instance, artworks by Da Vinci and Michelangelo are still revered today because they were not subjected to restrictions at the time. Ultimately, without any constraints, artists can deliver more awe-inspiring creations.\nMoreover, it is a fundamental human right to be able to express one's views freely, provided it does not cause societal issues. today, many nations strive to demonstrate their commitment to democracy. art serves as a medium to critique societal issues and government policies within a given country. To further exemplify, the renowned film '3 Idiots' featuring Aamir Khan critiques an education system focused on rote learning rather than practical application. Consequently, if artists are not allowed to express their emotions freely, it infringes upon human rights.\nFrom another angle, there are potential downsides if artists operate without restrictions. they might delve into topics that could spark controversies within a nation. For example, Malaysia is a multicultural country where citizens coexist peacefully. If someone raises sensitive racial issues in their films or books, it could lead to social unrest. Nevertheless, I am convinced that artists are aware of their limits and are unlikely to tarnish their reputation with reckless actions.\nIn conclusion, it is now clear that there should be no imposition of restrictions on artists' creations. allowing them to think freely provides an opportunity for self-expression since ideas can naturally emerge in the absence of restrictions. Therefore, even though the freedom to express ideas might have some negative impacts, I am firmly of the opinion that the freedom to express ideas has resulted in numerous wonderful and beautiful artworks and thus, I strongly believe there should be no limitations placed on them.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay081", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 272, "to": 372}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 385, "to": 491}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 517, "to": 649}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 665, "to": 786}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 800, "to": 873}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 885, "to": 1001}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1003, "to": 1074}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1076, "to": 1173}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1197, "to": 1335}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1351, "to": 1442}], "label": "Claim", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1535, "to": 1610}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1625, "to": 1694}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1696, "to": 1793}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1829, "to": 1929}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1967, "to": 2034}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2036, "to": 2109}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2116, "to": 2173}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2186, "to": 2259}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2293, "to": 2379}], "label": "Claim", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2409, "to": 2454}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 19}], "edges": [{"source": 4, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 17, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 4, 9, 12, 14, 18, 19]}

Studies indicate that friendships formed during university often become lifelong bonds, and this is especially true for those with whom we share living spaces. Personally, the primary attribute of a roommate is to be considerate. Meanwhile, effective communication is another crucial trait of a good roommate. \nBeing considerate is vital in any relationship. For instance, a roommate lowers the volume of music or television at night. Occasionally, we remain unaware of our actions until we experience the consequences ourselves. Consistently considering the feelings of others before engaging in self-focused actions can greatly enhance the roommate relationship. Hence, having a considerate roommate is crucial to our academic life. This approach not only prevents disputes but also fosters friendships or familial connections.\nFurthermore, good communication is also essential in forming a harmonious roommate relationship. Individuals have varying daily habits, like making the bed in the morning. Some may find this task simple, while others perceive it as a significant undertaking. Requesting a move due to a roommate not making the bed could be seen as an overreaction. Consequently, communication holds great importance because it helps in resolving misunderstandings. Through dialogue, bonds are formed and mutual understanding is enhanced.\nTo sum up, there are many beneficial factors about roommates that hold significance.

Maintaining enthusiasm for their field is essential so that they can continually propel themselves forward. Furthermore, they can enhance their teaching effectiveness. For example, the most memorable professor I encountered in university was Mr. Yang, who was dedicated to research and reading. He inspired us and taught us how to study independently and efficiently. Every classmate awarded him the highest rating, acknowledging him as an outstanding teacher.\nStudents can obtain information from textbooks, online resources, or instructors. However, we rely on professors when seeking to engage in research and advance ourselves. Without engaging in research, a professor cannot offer us these opportunities. Additionally, a professor deeply engaged in research is constantly thinking and generating fresh ideas. This may encourage us as students to propose innovative ideas. This benefits both the professor and the students.\nUltimately, university professors are valuable assets to society. They are pioneers in various fields such as science, arts, and culture.

And, this issue seems to be worsening. \nInitially, there should be more public transport alternatives available, such as subway or sky train systems. Consequently, people will have additional options for reaching various destinations. Given that currently, buses are the sole public transport option in this area, This leaves residents with no alternatives. They are forced to rely solely on buses for travel. With the availability of subways and sky trains, travel would be far more convenient. For instance, subway schedules allow people to predict travel times accurately. Conversely, this prediction isn't possible with buses. Additionally, enhancing public transport will indirectly alleviate road traffic issues. \nFurthermore, currently, buses operate only two routes within the community. This poses a significant challenge. For instance, when my destination isn't along a bus route, I have to first travel to a central station to change buses. Clearly, this process is time-consuming. Expanding the number of routes would facilitate easier transportation for residents.\nFinally, introducing more public transport options could reduce personal car usage. It also offers numerous benefits. For example, individuals could cut down on fuel expenses, which are increasingly costly.

Once students start earning, they might be reluctant to return to studies where they would forfeit their financial autonomy. They may also struggle to adjust back to an academic setting. There is the possibility that some students may never return to pursue higher education. Some might opt for short-term courses instead of a comprehensive university education, which can lead to better job opportunities and salaries in the immediate term. However, this could be a short-lived benefit, as it is widely recognized that a solid and higher qualification is necessary for a sustainable career in the long run.\nFrom my perspective, I am in favor of the idea of taking a break before embarking on higher education.

{"id": "id_15", "input": "I believe it is not advisable for teenagers to hold jobs while they are still students. While many assert that it offers valuable work experience, I am convinced it can disrupt their lives in several respects. Having jobs could negatively impact students' health. It distracts them from academics and detracts from their childhood years.\nIn today's competitive environment, students need to engage heavily in academics to succeed. They must dedicate most of their time to school to achieve good grades. If students spend their remaining time working, it adds extra pressure on them. Additionally, Jobs come with responsibilities such as punctuality and sometimes additional tasks. This can lead to stress, anxiety, and fatigue. They won't have sufficient time for relaxation or sleep. Consequently, this could affect their mental and physical well-being.\nAnother point is that Jobs may distract students from their academic pursuits. If students begin earning money at a young age, they might become enticed by it. They perceive themselves as independent and may prioritize working more for financial gain. This can impact their academic focus, causing a loss of interest in education. Furthermore, They might abandon their studies to earn more.\nMoreover, A significant downside of teenage employment is missing out on the joys of childhood. They miss opportunities for childhood activities like socializing with friends, joining clubs, engaging in fun events, and interacting socially. They have their entire lives to work and achieve, but childhood will never return. Hence, they should make the most of life's opportunities while they can.\nIn conclusion, for teenagers, focusing on their education is crucial.

{"id": "id_16", "input": "In today's world, closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras are extensively used in various settings. They are implemented in schools, businesses, and other establishments to keep an eye on ongoing activities. It is undeniable that CCTV usage has numerous advantages, particularly in curbing crime and safeguarding employees within a premise. Nonetheless, some individuals contend that these cameras infringe on their privacy due to the constant surveillance. Despite this, I am firmly convinced that CCTV cameras ought to be installed in all premises to tackle the rising theft rates and to ensure the protection of workers at their workplaces.\nTo begin with, installing CCTV cameras at workplaces can significantly reduce crimes like robbery. This is due to the fact that in the event of a theft, recordings from these cameras provide crucial evidence to help track down the culprits. For instance, in Malaysia, law enforcement successfully used CCTV footage to locate and apprehend a group of robbers who had broken into a Seven Eleven store at night. Additionally, knowing they are under surveillance, employees are less inclined to commit theft in stores. Consequently, it is evident that CCTV systems should be installed in all workplaces to help lower crime rates.\nMoreover, in some offices, employees frequently deal with upset or irate customers. Sometimes, interacting with an angry customer face-to-face can pose a physical threat to the employee. Therefore, CCTV installations can assist employees in avoiding such risky encounters because customers are aware that their interactions are being recorded. In case of a disagreement, the footage can be reviewed to ascertain the facts and take appropriate measures. In summary, these cameras offer some level of protection for employees against customers.\nFrom another angle, the deployment of CCTV cameras does spark debate. Critics argue that the constant monitoring by CCTV systems encroaches on their privacy. However, it is crucial to recognize that safety holds greater significance than privacy, and it is preferable to prevent issues rather than face their consequences. Hence, those against the system should strive to understand the circumstances and take steps to protect themselves from becoming crime victims.\nIn conclusion, CCTV cameras are indispensable and thus should be installed in every establishment. This is primarily to protect individuals from potential harm by intruders or thieves. While it is true that privacy is compromised with the implementation of these cameras. Nevertheless, prioritizing safety is essential to ensure protection.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay085", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 500, "to": 643}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 660, "to": 742}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 773, "to": 884}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 900, "to": 1052}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1068, "to": 1158}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1193, "to": 1269}], "label": "Claim", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1281, "to": 1353}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1366, "to": 1456}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1469, "to": 1542}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1551, "to": 1613}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1642, "to": 1722}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1736, "to": 1812}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1884, "to": 1970}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1981, "to": 2135}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2144, "to": 2279}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2296, "to": 2378}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2380, "to": 2464}], "label": "Claim", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2488, "to": 2551}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2567, "to": 2620}], "label": "Premise", "id": 18}], "edges": [{"source": 5, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 16, "target": 17, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 17, "target": 18, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 5, 11, 12, 15, 16]}

From my perspective, while the significance of endangered animals cannot be understated, the needs of humanity should take precedence.\nTo begin with, the population is steadily rising, consequently there is a corresponding rise in the demand for food. To sustain life, we require agricultural land to cultivate essential crops like wheat and corn, as it is undeniable that survival beyond a few weeks without food is impossible. Hence, farmlands are indispensable for humanity's sustenance.\nMoreover, individuals require protection from elements like wind, floods, and wild animals, necessitating shelters, thus land is essential for constructing homes. Housing is undeniably a fundamental need for humans, second only to food.\nLastly, humans require essential industrial products, like medicine, for survival. Consequently, allocating land for industrial purposes is necessary. Modern life presents challenges that are alleviated through industrial advancement.\nIn conclusion, the number of endangered animals is significantly lower than the human population, therefore their land requirements are far less compared to human needs.

{"id": "id_18", "input": "When considering a career path, it's crucial to weigh your options carefully. The decision to pursue a profession akin to one's parents' can evoke varied opinions among individuals. Personally, I believe that opting for a career similar to that of one's parents can be advantageous for one's professional journey. \nFirstly, since parents are immersed in the same field, they can offer substantial support to their offspring, including domain expertise and industry-specific insights. Take for instance, my dad works as a software programmer, and he has imparted a great deal of programming and computer knowledge to me. Whenever I encountered challenges, I would seek his advice. Given that his wealth of experience, I am able to save significant time in resolving issues. This genuinely enhances my competitiveness compared to my peers. Had I chosen a different field from my father's, I would likely face more challenges than I do currently.\nHowever, since parents have spent decades in their professions, they have built a substantial network within a particular industry. They possess profound insight into it and can offer significant assistance to their children. For example, they are aware of which companies offer superior benefits or provide better training opportunities. Additionally, their acquaintances in the industry might even aid in drafting recommendation letters for specific companies. A strong recommendation letter is undeniably crucial in today's competitive environment. While others may still be perfecting their resumes, someone with an excellent recommendation letter has already cleared the initial stage of the interview process. \nSome may contend that, with changing times, the job market conditions have undergone a complete transformation. Thus, selecting a career similar to one's parents' isn't always the right choice. I partially resonate with this view, yet when it comes to predicting trends, accuracy is elusive. The job market fluctuates rapidly, akin to a flash, implying that it's impossible to foresee any profession remaining popular for three decades or more.\nIn the deliberation of whether to follow in one's parents' professional footsteps, I've outlined several reasons why one can receive greater support from their parents if they are in the same industry.

{"id": "id_20", "input": "Attending university lectures is one of the activities students typically engage in. However, classes are not the sole avenue for acquiring knowledge. Students can also learn through experiences, libraries, and interactions with others. I believe students should have the choice to attend classes or not due to the following reasons.\nFirstly, one reason university students shouldn't be mandated to attend classes is often, university students can gain more knowledge from sources outside the classroom. students can self-study in the library, concentrating on topics they find challenging. For instance, I have a close friend who was in the same academic department as me at university. She grasped the material quickly and comprehended everything in class rapidly. Therefore, she seldom attended lectures, choosing instead to dedicate her time to mastering difficult topics. Ultimately, she graduated with excellent grades.\nSecondly, students should not be obligated to attend lectures because they can allocate the time spent on classes to pursue other beneficial activities if they are already proficient in the subject matter. Based on my experience, there were many occasions when I skipped biology classes because my university did not make attendance mandatory. Additionally, I had previously covered all biology topics before starting university.

{"id": "id_24", "input": "Artists across the globe typically enjoy the liberty to convey their thoughts through their work. However, some contend that government-imposed limitations are necessary to curb their expressions. I, on the other hand, partially agree and hold the view that artists should have the freedom to create, resulting in extraordinary masterpieces.\nFirst and foremost, imposing restrictions on artists' creativity will inevitably stifle their ingenuity over time. It is clear that when afforded the chance to express freely, artists often think innovatively and produce remarkable creations, such as paintings or films. A case in point is Da Vinci and Michelangelo's artworks are still revered today because they faced no constraints during their time. In essence, without constraints, artists are likely to produce more inspiring works.\nMoreover, every individual has the right to express their views in any manner, as long as it does not harm the nation. many nations today strive to demonstrate that they uphold democratic principles. art serves as a medium to critique social issues and governmental policies within a nation. To further illustrate, the renowned film '3 Idiots' starring Aamir Khan critiques an education system focused on rote learning rather than practical application. Therefore, restricting artists' freedom infringes upon human rights.\nFrom a different angle, drawbacks arise if artists lack restrictions. artists might explore sensitive topics that could spark controversies within a country. For instance, Malaysia is a diverse nation where people of different races coexist peacefully. addressing sensitive racial issues in media could lead to societal unrest. Nevertheless, I maintain that artists are aware of their limits and would avoid actions that could tarnish their reputation.\nIn conclusion, it is apparent that artists' work should remain unrestricted. giving them the freedom to think allows for genuine self-expression as ideas flow more naturally in the absence of restrictions. Consequently, despite potential negative outcomes of unrestrained expression, I am convinced that freedom of expression has led to many wonderful and beautiful art pieces and thus, I strongly assert that artists should face no restrictions.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay081", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 258, "to": 340}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 362, "to": 455}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 474, "to": 611}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 632, "to": 744}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 758, "to": 829}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 841, "to": 948}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 950, "to": 1029}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1031, "to": 1121}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1146, "to": 1283}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1296, "to": 1352}], "label": "Claim", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1424, "to": 1510}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1526, "to": 1605}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1607, "to": 1680}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1712, "to": 1805}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1842, "to": 1882}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1884, "to": 1951}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1955, "to": 2011}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2027, "to": 2089}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2111, "to": 2183}], "label": "Claim", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2217, "to": 2252}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 19}], "edges": [{"source": 4, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 17, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 4, 9, 12, 14, 18, 19]}

Studies indicate that friendships formed during university are likely to become lifelong, particularly with roommates. From my perspective, the most vital trait of roommates is their thoughtfulness. Meanwhile, being able to communicate effectively is also a crucial characteristic of a good roommate. \nThoughtfulness is a cornerstone in any relationship. For instance, a roommate lowers the music or TV volume at night. Sometimes we remain oblivious to our actions until we experience similar situations. Consistently considering others' feelings before engaging in self-centered actions can greatly enhance roommate relationships. Consequently, having a considerate roommate is crucial to our academic life. This not only helps avoid disputes but can also lead to forming a friendship or even a familial bond.\nFurthermore, effective communication equally contributes to being a good roommate. Individuals have varied daily habits, like making the bed every morning. While some may view this as a simple task, others might find it a substantial undertaking. If someone wants to move out just because their roommate doesn't make the bed, it might be an overreaction. Thus, communication plays a pivotal role since it helps to resolve misunderstandings. Through communication, bonds are formed, leading to an improved understanding of one another.\nTo sum up, roommates possess numerous valuable traits that are crucial.

If art depicts unreality, the public undoubtedly has the insight to recognize its falsehood and simply appreciate its artistic value; if art mirrors reality, then what purpose would banning it serve other than concealing unpleasant truths?

I wholeheartedly agree that limitations on exposure for adolescents should be enforced as young people lack the maturity to avoid being misled by these themes; however, when adults are the audience, there is nothing to conceal \u2013 these negative elements exist in the world, and adults cannot be brainwashed merely by some creative expressions.\nIn conclusion, I oppose the notion of imposing restrictions on artists' work; rather, they should be motivated to share their inventive ideas \u2013 the world needs them to add vibrancy.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay067", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 234, "to": 366}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 368, "to": 498}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 527, "to": 628}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 658, "to": 838}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 840, "to": 972}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1178, "to": 1220}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1296, "to": 1380}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1410, "to": 1468}], "label": "Claim", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1472, "to": 1540}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1551, "to": 1723}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1811, "to": 1866}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1869, "to": 1905}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 1, "target": 3, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 1, "target": 5, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 7, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 7, 10, 11]}
{"id": "id_28", "input": "When choosing a place to live, public utilities and the surrounding environment are the main considerations. Yet, finding a community that perfectly fits our needs is challenging. In my hometown, almost all necessary public facilities are available except for transportation. Thus, what I truly wish to change is the addition of more public transport options. Since I encounter traffic jams daily. And this issue seems to be worsening.\nInitially, more public transportation options like a subway or sky train should be available. Hence, people would have more alternatives for reaching their destinations. Given that currently, buses are the sole form of public transportation in this area, This leaves the residents with no other options. They are compelled to rely solely on buses to travel elsewhere. If both a subway and sky train were introduced, it would greatly enhance their convenience. For instance, people can plan their travel time using the subway train schedule. Conversely, this is not possible with bus services. Additionally, this enhancement would indirectly alleviate road traffic issues.\nSecondly, the buses in this community offer only two routes. This is undeniably a significant issue. For instance, if my intended destination is not on the bus route, I have to take a bus to the central station first to switch to another bus. Clearly, this results in a considerable waste of time. More routes should be added to facilitate easier transportation for the public.\nFinally, introducing more varieties of public transport could reduce the number of personal car users. Furthermore, it offers numerous benefits. For example, people can cut down on fuel costs, which are continually rising. Essential energy resources will be gradually conserved, since individuals use their personal vehicles less frequently.\nIn conclusion, transportation is a fundamental factor that directly impacts people's quality of life.

This trend is seen not only among affluent students but also among those from less privileged backgrounds. Many students opt for a gap year or two, with some choosing to explore the globe, while others decide to take up employment.\nThe experiences gained from traveling to various destinations, engaging with diverse individuals, and even working, have lasting benefits. These experiences not only boost a student's self-assurance but also foster independence. Students who work during their break tend to accumulate financial resources that can support them during their university years. This exposure helps them gain clarity on what they aspire to achieve in life. They cultivate a wider perspective, enabling them to make informed decisions about their future academic pursuits.\nWhile taking a break offers advantages, it also presents certain drawbacks. Once students start earning, they may be reluctant to return to academia, fearing the loss of financial autonomy. They may struggle to readjust to the educational setting. There's a danger that some students may never return to pursue higher education. Some might opt for short-term courses over a comprehensive university education, seeking better job prospects and salaries.

While many insist that it provides valuable work experience, I contend that it can disrupt their lives in several ways. Taking on jobs can negatively impact students' health. It pulls their focus away from academics and robs them of their childhood.\nIn today's competitive environment, students need to dedicate significant time to studying to succeed.

This shift in focus can harm their academic performance and interest in studying. Furthermore, They might even abandon their studies to pursue greater earnings.\nBesides, A significant downside to teenagers working is missing out on the joys of childhood.

{"id": "id_31", "input": "Nowadays, closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras are prevalent in numerous settings. They are present in educational institutions, businesses, and various other locations with the aim of observing ongoing activities. It's indisputable that deploying CCTV offers numerous advantages, particularly in curbing criminal activities and safeguarding employees within a facility. However, there are concerns that these cameras infringe on personal privacy due to continuous surveillance. Despite this, I firmly assert that CCTV cameras should be installed across all premises to tackle the rising theft rates and ensure the safety of employees at their workplaces.\nTo begin with, installing CCTV cameras at workplaces can significantly reduce crimes like robbery. This holds true because when a store is targeted by thieves, footage from these cameras provides crucial evidence for tracking the perpetrators. For instance, in Malaysia, law enforcement successfully apprehended a gang of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven store at night using video evidence from CCTV cameras. Additionally, employees, aware of being under surveillance, are less inclined to commit theft. Therefore, it is evident that CCTV cameras should be mandatory in workplaces to help lower crime rates.\nMoreover, in certain offices, staff frequently deal with irate or dissatisfied customers. Occasionally, interacting directly with a distressed customer can pose a physical threat to the employee. Thus, CCTV camera installations can provide employees with a means to evade such dangers because customers are fully aware that their interactions are being recorded. During a dispute, video recordings can be used to clarify the events that transpired, facilitating appropriate actions. In summary, these cameras offer a form of protection for employees against customer-related incidents.\nFrom a different angle, employing CCTV cameras does stir debate. Critics of CCTV systems argue that constant surveillance invades their privacy. Nevertheless, it's crucial to understand that safety outweighs privacy concerns, and prevention is preferable to dealing with aftermaths. Consequently, opponents should aim to grasp the situation and take measures to avoid falling victim to crime.\nIn conclusion, CCTV cameras are vital and should be implemented in every premise. Primarily, this is to protect individuals from potential harm caused by intruders or thieves. It is acknowledged that the use of these cameras does result in a loss of privacy.

{"id": "id_33", "input": "When deciding on a career path, it's essential to give it careful thought. People often differ on whether to pursue a career that mirrors their parents' professions. Personally, I believe that choosing a profession akin to one's parents' can be advantageous for one's career. \nTo begin with, since parents are immersed in the same field, they are able to offer significant support to their children, including expertise and insights related to the industry. For instance, my father is a software developer, and he has indeed taught me a great deal about programming and computer science. Whenever I encountered a challenge, I would consult him. Given that his extensive experience, I can save a tremendous amount of time in problem-solving. This genuinely gives me a competitive edge over my peers. Had I chosen a different field than my father, I would have encountered more challenges.\nNonetheless, because parents have decades of experience in their industry, they have built a vast network within the sector. They possess profound insights and can offer substantial support to their offspring. For example, they know which companies offer superior benefits or better opportunities for growth. Furthermore, their connections in the industry can even assist by providing recommendation letters to specific companies. Undeniably, a strong recommendation letter is crucial in today's competitive environment. While others are busy preparing their resumes, someone with a solid recommendation letter has already cleared the initial hurdle in the interview process. \nSome might contend that, as times have changed, the job market conditions are entirely different now. Consequently, selecting a career similar to one's parents' isn't always the right choice. I partially agree with this view, but no one can accurately forecast the trends.

Students have the option to study independently in libraries, concentrating on topics they find challenging. For instance, I have a close friend who was enrolled in the same department as me at university. She grasped class material swiftly and comprehended everything rapidly. Consequently, she seldom attended class, choosing instead to deepen her understanding of complex subjects. Ultimately, she graduated with excellent grades.\nAdditionally, the rationale for not requiring students to attend classes is that students can allocate time spent in classes to other beneficial activities if they have mastered the class content. Based on my personal experience, I often skipped biology classes because my university does not enforce mandatory attendance. Furthermore, I had already covered all biology topics prior to enrolling in university. Therefore, I utilized the time allocated for biology classes to work on my Chemistry research, earning A+ grades in both subjects. \nIn summary, I believe students should be adept at determining their priorities and effectively managing their study time.

It is unquestionable that when artists are allowed to express themselves, they often think innovatively and produce remarkable creations like paintings or films.

In essence, without restrictions, artists can produce more inspiring and magnificent works.\nAdditionally, everyone has the right to express their views, provided they do not disrupt the nation. Today, many nations endeavor to demonstrate that they uphold democratic values. Art serves as a medium to critique societal issues and government policies within a country.

Therefore, prohibiting artists from freely expressing their emotions infringes on human rights.\nFrom an alternative viewpoint, there are certain disadvantages if artists operate without restrictions. they might delve into topics that spark controversy within a nation.

{"id": "id_40", "input": "There's been much discourse regarding the significance of having good roommates and how they influence our school life. Studies indicate that friendships formed during university often become lifelong bonds, particularly with roommates. Personally, the most crucial attribute of roommates is being considerate. Additionally, effective communication is another vital trait of a good roommate. \nConsideration holds a pivotal role in relationships. For instance, a roommate who lowers the music or TV volume at night demonstrates thoughtfulness. There are times we remain unaware of our actions until we experience the consequences ourselves. Consistently considering the other person's feelings before acting selfishly can greatly enhance roommate relations. Consequently, having a considerate roommate is immensely crucial to our academic life. It not only averts disputes but also fosters friendships or even familial bonds.\nFurthermore, communication also plays a role in making a good roommate. Different people have varied daily habits, like tidying up the blanket in the morning. Some may see this as a simple task, while others might view it as a major undertaking. If someone chooses to move out merely because their roommate doesn't tidy the blanket, it might be an overreaction. Thus, communication proves to be extremely vital since as it helps to dispel misunderstandings. Through communication, bonds are forged, leading to a better grasp of each other's perspectives.\nTo summarize, numerous valuable aspects of having a roommate are crucial.

They must maintain a fervor for their subject area, enabling they can continually advance in their field. Additionally, This improvement in their research can enhance their teaching abilities. For example, Mr. Yang, the most memorable professor during my university years, is devoted to research and reading. He inspired us and taught us how to study more effectively on our own. All my classmates rated him AAA, marking him as an outstanding teacher.\nStudents can access information through books, websites, or instructors. However, We rely on professors when we wish to engage in research and advance ourselves. If professors are not engaged in research, they cannot provide us with such opportunities. Furthermore, A professor deeply involved in research is constantly generating new ideas. They may inspire students to propose creative ideas. This benefits both professors and students.\nUltimately, Professors are valuable assets to society. They are pioneers in various domains such as science, arts, and culture. Without their research, technological advancements would slow significantly. Without research, more artworks would be lost to time.

{"id": "id_43", "input": "When deciding where to live, public facilities and the environment are crucial considerations. Yet, finding a community that perfectly satisfies all of our needs is challenging. In my hometown, there are nearly all necessary public utilities except for transportation. Therefore, what I truly wish to change is the addition of more public transportation options. Given that I have to deal with traffic jams every single day, this issue seems to be worsening.\nInitially, there should be more options for public transportation, like a subway or a sky train. Consequently, people will have a variety of ways to reach their destinations. Considering currently, buses are the sole form of public transportation available in this community, This leaves residents with no alternatives. They are forced to rely solely on buses to travel elsewhere. Having a subway and sky train would offer greater convenience. For instance, people can plan their time efficiently with a subway because of the fixed schedule. In contrast, this is not possible with buses. Additionally, this enhancement will indirectly reduce traffic congestion on the roads.\nSecondly, the buses only serve two routes within this community. This is undeniably a significant issue. For example, if my intended destination is not on the bus route, I still have to take a bus to the central station and switch to another bus. Clearly, this results in a considerable waste of time. They should expand the routes to facilitate easier transportation for residents.\nFinally, having more forms of public transportation can reduce the number of people using personal cars. Moreover, it offers numerous benefits. For example, people can cut down on fuel expenses, which are growing increasingly costly. Vital energy resources will be consumed more slowly, because people rely less on their personal vehicles.\nIn conclusion, transportation is a fundamental aspect that directly impacts people's quality of life.

{"id": "id_46", "input": "Nowadays, closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras are extensively employed in various settings, including schools, businesses, and other locations, to keep an eye on ongoing activities. It's undeniable that CCTV offers numerous advantages, particularly in deterring crime and safeguarding employees within a premise. However, some individuals contend that these cameras encroach on their privacy due to constant surveillance. Nonetheless, I firmly assert that CCTV cameras ought to be installed in every premise to tackle the rising theft rates and safeguard workers at their workplaces.\nTo begin with, installing CCTV cameras at workplaces can significantly reduce crimes like theft. This is because when a store is targeted by thieves, footage captured by these cameras can serve as evidence to track down the culprits. To further elaborate, in Malaysia, police utilized CCTV footage to track and apprehend a gang of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven store at midnight. Additionally, employees, aware of continuous monitoring, are less likely to steal from the establishments. Consequently, it becomes evident that CCTVs should be installed in all workplaces to help lower crime rates.\nMoreover, in some offices, employees frequently deal with irate or dissatisfied customers. Occasionally, face-to-face encounters with an irate customer can pose a physical threat to employees. Therefore, CCTV cameras can help employees avoid these risky situations because customers are well aware that their interactions are being recorded. In case of disputes, video recordings can be reviewed to ascertain what transpired, allowing appropriate actions to be taken. In summary, these cameras can offer a layer of protection for workers against customers.\nFrom another viewpoint, the deployment of CCTV cameras does spark debate. Critics of CCTV systems argue that their privacy is compromised due to relentless surveillance. Nevertheless, it's crucial to recognize that safety is more important than privacy, and preventing problems is preferable to dealing with their aftermath.

Farmlands are essential for cultivating crops like wheat and corn, and it is undeniable that without food, people cannot survive beyond a few weeks. Thus, farmlands are crucial to human survival.\nMoreover, humans require shelters to safeguard themselves against natural elements like wind, floods, and wild animals, which means they need land for constructing their homes. Shelter is an undeniable necessity for humans, second only to food.\nLastly, humans require essential items to sustain their lives, many of which are industrial, such as medicines. Hence, some areas must be dedicated to industrial use. Modern life presents challenges that are eased by industrial advancements. \nIn summary, the number of endangered animals is significantly smaller than the human population, indicating that they require far less land compared to humans.

In my opinion, I believe picking a career that mirrors one's parents can be advantageous for one's professional growth. \nFirstly, since parents are immersed in the same professional setting, they can offer substantial assistance to their offspring, including expertise and information pertinent to the industry. For instance, my father is a software developer, and he has imparted a wealth of programming knowledge and computer skills to me. Whenever I encounter challenges, I turn to him for guidance. Since he possesses extensive experience, I can save a considerable amount of time seeking solutions. This truly enhances my competitiveness compared to my peers. Had I chosen a different field from my father, I would confront more difficulties than I currently do.\nHowever, given that parents have spent decades in their professions, they have built a substantial network within a particular sector. They possess profound insights into it and can offer significant support to their children. For example, they are aware of which companies offer superior benefits or educational opportunities. Additionally, their connections in the industry might even help by drafting recommendation letters for specific companies. It's undeniable that a strong recommendation letter holds immense value in today's competitive world.

Consequently, opting for a career similar to one's parents isn't always the right choice. While I partially agree with this perspective, it's impossible to accurately predict industry trends. The job market conditions shift rapidly and unexpectedly, thus there's no assurance that any profession will remain desirable for three decades or longer.\nIn evaluating whether one should opt for a job akin to their parents', I have highlighted several reasons why individuals can receive more support from their parents if they share the same professional domain.

Students also have the opportunity to study independently in libraries, concentrating solely on topics they find challenging. For instance, I have a friend who was in the same department as me during our university days. She grasped concepts swiftly and comprehended everything covered in class with ease. Consequently, she seldom attended classes but dedicated most of her time to mastering difficult subjects. Ultimately, she graduated with excellent grades.\nMoreover, students should not be compelled to attend lectures because students can allocate the time spent in classes to pursue other worthwhile activities if they have a solid grasp of the classroom topics. Based on my personal experience, there were numerous instances when I skipped biology lectures because my university did not enforce class attendance. Additionally, I had already familiarized myself with all the biology topics prior to enrolling in university. Therefore, I utilized the time allocated for biology classes to focus on my Chemistry research, ultimately achieving A+ grades in both subjects. \nIn summary, I believe students should be adept at identifying which activities to prioritize at any given time and efficiently organizing their study schedules.

Furthermore, the application of technological science in medication preparation also plays a crucial role in preserving the lives of numerous patients.\nOn the other hand, some negative aspects of technological advancements need to be clearly acknowledged. Despite offering tremendous benefits, the production process of technological products has indirectly harmed the natural environment. This stems from the fact that the extraction and gathering of raw materials and essential fuels for technological product manufacturing have severely damaged nature. Lastly, technology can significantly reduce creativity in certain groups, particularly children and young people, due to reliance on existing advancements.\nTo conclude, I firmly believe that technology has greatly contributed to our lives and the advancement of civilization. We cannot overlook the profound impact that substantial technological progress has had on human life. Nevertheless, its negative effects require more prudent management.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay383", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 461, "to": 535}], "label": "Claim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 537, "to": 735}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 750, "to": 887}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1031, "to": 1125}], "label": "Claim", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1157, "to": 1291}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1301, "to": 1447}], "label": "Claim", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1484, "to": 1567}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1569, "to": 1669}], "label": "Claim", "id": 7}], "edges": [{"source": 0, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 0, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 3, 5, 6, 7]}
{"id": "id_54", "input": "In most countries, artists are granted the liberty to articulate their thoughts through their work. However, some believe that the government should impose restrictions to curb their expressions. I partly concur with this view but hold that artists should have the freedom to create, which can lead to the production of exceptional masterpieces.\nFirstly, if there is a restriction on artists' concepts, they are likely to lose their creative edge over time. It is clear that when they have the liberty to express themselves, most artists think innovatively, producing outstanding works such as paintings or films. For instance, the works of Da Vinci and Michelangelo are still revered today because they were not restricted in their time. In essence, unrestricted expression will lead to more remarkable creations from artists.\nMoreover, every individual has the right to express their views freely, provided it does not cause national issues. many nations today strive to demonstrate their commitment to democracy. art can serve as a medium to critique social issues and governmental policies within a country. To further exemplify, the renowned film '3 Idiots' starring Aamir Khan critiques an education system focused on rote learning rather than practical application. Therefore, denying artists the freedom to express themselves is a violation of human rights.\nFrom another viewpoint, certain risks arise if artists operate without constraints. artists might delve into topics that could spark controversies within a country. For example, Malaysia is a multicultural nation where citizens coexist peacefully. if someone addresses sensitive racial issues in their art, it could lead to societal unrest. Nevertheless, I am convinced that artists are generally aware of their limits and would not wish to tarnish their reputations through reckless actions.\nIn conclusion, it is apparent that there should be no limitations on artists' creations. giving them the freedom to think will provide an avenue for self-expression since ideas can flow naturally without restrictions. Thus, although the freedom to express ideas can have some adverse effects, I firmly believe that many beautiful and remarkable artworks exist due to the freedom of expression and consequently, I am strongly of the opinion that there should be no constraints placed on them.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay081", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 241, "to": 344}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 355, "to": 456}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 475, "to": 612}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 628, "to": 737}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 751, "to": 826}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 838, "to": 942}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 944, "to": 1014}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1016, "to": 1110}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1134, "to": 1271}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1284, "to": 1364}], "label": "Claim", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1450, "to": 1529}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1544, "to": 1612}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1614, "to": 1705}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1741, "to": 1857}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1894, "to": 1946}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1948, "to": 2023}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2030, "to": 2075}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2083, "to": 2150}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2174, "to": 2251}], "label": "Claim", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2304, "to": 2349}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 19}], "edges": [{"source": 4, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 17, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 4, 9, 12, 14, 18, 19]}
{"id": "id_55", "input": "There's been a lot of discussion about the significance of having good roommates and how they can influence our school life. Studies indicate that friendships formed at university often turn into lifelong connections, especially with those who are roommates. Personally, the most vital trait of a roommate is being considerate. Meanwhile, effective communication is another crucial characteristic of a good roommate. \nConsideration plays a key role in any relationship. For instance, a roommate lowering the music or TV volume at night. There are times when we don't realize our actions until we experience them ourselves. Consistently considering the other's feelings before engaging in self-centered acts can greatly enhance the roommate relationship. Consequently, having a considerate roommate is extremely crucial for our academic life. It helps to avoid conflicts and fosters friendships or even familial bonds.\nFurthermore, communication also contributes to making a great roommate. Individuals have varying habits, like making the bed each morning. One person might find this simple, while another sees it as a daunting task. Requesting a move due to a roommate not making the bed might be an overreaction. Thus, communication holds significant importance, as it helps to resolve misunderstandings. Through communication, bonds are formed, leading to better mutual understanding.\nTo sum up, there are numerous valuable aspects of having a roommate that matter.

{"id": "id_56", "input": "While university professors are fundamentally educators, focusing on teaching, we must not overlook their significant role in research. I believe that professors should allocate more time to research rather than focusing solely on teaching students for several reasons outlined below.\nA professor is essentially a researcher or a specialist in a particular field of science. They should consistently maintain enthusiasm for their area of expertise so that they can continually propel themselves forward. Following this, they can enhance their teaching capabilities. For example, the most remarkable professor I encountered during my university studies was Mr. Yang, who is dedicated to research and reading. He was also the one who inspired us and taught us how to study more effectively on our own. All of my classmates rated him as AAA, the outstanding teacher.\nFor students, we can acquire knowledge from textbooks, websites, or teachers. However, we can only rely on our professors when we wish to engage in research and advance ourselves. If a professor is not involved in research, they cannot provide us with such opportunities. Moreover, a professor focused on research is constantly thinking and generating new ideas. They may inspire us students to propose innovative suggestions. This benefits both the professor and the students.\nIn the end, all university professors are assets to society. They are leaders in nearly every domain of science, arts, culture, and more. Without their research, new technologies would not emerge rapidly. Without their research, more artworks would be lost to oblivion. Without their research, less information about our ancestors would be known worldwide.\nIn summary, professors should consistently engage in research throughout their teaching careers at the university.

It goes without saying that art inherently includes imagination, exaggeration, and sometimes is entirely fictional; whether a piece of art is rooted in reality or not, it is up to the public to decide how to interpret its significance. If art presents falsehoods, the public surely has the insight to identify its inaccuracy and appreciate its artistic value; if art mirrors reality, then why would there be a need to censor it unless to conceal uncomfortable truths?

In my hometown, while public utilities are almost complete, the transportation system is lacking. Thus, what I truly wish to change is to introduce more public transportation options. Because I encounter traffic congestion daily. And this issue seems to be worsening.\nInitially, there should be more options for public transportation, like a subway or a sky train. Consequently, individuals will have more choices for reaching their destinations. Given that currently, buses are the sole form of public transit available in this area, it leaves residents with no alternative. they are compelled to take a bus to travel elsewhere. introducing a subway and sky train would greatly enhance convenience for them. Take for instance, people can plan their schedules based on subway train timetables. in contrast, this is not possible with buses. Furthermore, this enhancement would indirectly alleviate road traffic problems.\nMoreover, buses currently offer only two routes here. this is undeniably a significant issue. For example, if my intended location isn't on the bus route, I must first travel to the central station to switch buses. Clearly, this results in a loss of time. additional routes should be established to facilitate easier transportation.\nFinally, expanding public transport options could reduce the reliance on personal vehicles. Additionally, it offers numerous benefits. For example, individuals can cut down on fuel costs, which are becoming increasingly expensive.

If students begin earning at a young age, they may become drawn to money. They might feel independent and choose to work more to earn money. This could harm their academic pursuits, causing them to lose interest in studies. Furthermore, they might abandon their education in favor of earning more money.\nAlso, The primary downside of teenage employment is missing out on childhood enjoyment. They would miss out on various activities like hanging out with friends, joining clubs, engaging in fun pursuits, and socializing. They have a lifetime to work and prove themselves, but their childhood phase is irreplaceable. Hence, they should make the most of life while they can.\nConsequently, it's crucial for teenagers to focus on their education. Having a job would compromise their health, divert their attention from academics, and deprive them of an essential life stage.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay189", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 21, "to": 97}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 105, "to": 157}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 169, "to": 216}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 218, "to": 263}], "label": "Claim", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 265, "to": 330}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 332, "to": 435}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 437, "to": 504}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 506, "to": 589}], "label": "Claim", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 605, "to": 690}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 692, "to": 734}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 736, "to": 790}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 803, "to": 857}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 874, "to": 926}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 928, "to": 1000}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1002, "to": 1067}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1069, "to": 1150}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1165, "to": 1230}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1238, "to": 1318}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1320, "to": 1449}], "label": "Premise", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1451, "to": 1544}], "label": "Premise", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1553, "to": 1601}], "label": "Claim", "id": 20}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1617, "to": 1671}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 21}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1673, "to": 1799}], "label": "Claim", "id": 22}], "edges": [{"source": 7, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 20, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 20, "target": 18, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 20, "target": 19, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 11, 12, 20, 21, 22]}
{"id": "id_61", "input": "In today's world, closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras are extensively utilized across various settings. They are employed in educational institutions, businesses, and other locations to keep an eye on ongoing activities. It is indisputable that the deployment of CCTV provides numerous advantages, notably in curbing criminal activities and safeguarding employees within a facility. However, some individuals contend that these cameras infringe on their privacy due to perpetual observation. Despite this, I firmly assert that CCTV cameras should be installed in every establishment to address the rising theft rates and ensure the safety of employees at their workplaces.\nFirstly, installing CCTV cameras at workplaces can help reduce crimes such as theft. This is because in cases of theft, footage from these cameras can serve as critical evidence to track down the perpetrators. To further exemplify, in Malaysia, police utilized CCTV footage to identify and apprehend a gang of robbers who targeted a Seven Eleven store during the night. Additionally, employees are less likely to commit theft knowing they are under constant surveillance. Consequently, it becomes evident that CCTVs should be installed in all workplaces to decrease crime rates.\nMoreover, in certain offices, employees frequently deal with irate or upset customers. Sometimes, interacting directly with an angry customer can pose a physical threat to the employee. Therefore, the presence of CCTV cameras can assist employees in avoiding such dangerous situations because customers are aware that their interactions are being recorded. In case of a disagreement, video recordings can be used to verify incidents and decide on appropriate actions. In summary, these cameras offer a form of protection for workers against customer aggression.\nFrom a different viewpoint, the implementation of CCTV cameras does stir debate. Critics of CCTV systems argue that continuous camera monitoring violates their privacy. Nonetheless, it is crucial to prioritize safety over privacy, as prevention is preferable to dealing with negative outcomes. Therefore, those opposed to CCTV should understand the situation and take steps to protect themselves from becoming crime victims.\nIn conclusion, CCTV cameras are vital and should be installed in every facility. The primary reason is to protect against potential harm from intruders or thieves. While it is true that privacy concerns arise with the implementation of these cameras. Yet, prioritizing safety is essential for ensuring security.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay085", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 532, "to": 676}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 687, "to": 761}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 779, "to": 886}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 910, "to": 1046}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1062, "to": 1148}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1188, "to": 1255}], "label": "Claim", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1267, "to": 1342}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1355, "to": 1441}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1454, "to": 1541}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1550, "to": 1612}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1641, "to": 1723}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1737, "to": 1817}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1900, "to": 1986}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2001, "to": 2111}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2124, "to": 2242}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2259, "to": 2323}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2325, "to": 2406}], "label": "Claim", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2430, "to": 2493}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2500, "to": 2554}], "label": "Premise", "id": 18}], "edges": [{"source": 5, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 16, "target": 17, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 17, "target": 18, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 5, 11, 12, 15, 16]}

Two of the most significant are the rapidly growing population and the threat to plants and animals facing extinction. From my perspective, although the protection of endangered species is crucial, the needs of humanity should take precedence.\nTo begin with, the population is continuously rising, consequently there is a growing demand for food among humans. We require agricultural land to cultivate essential crops like wheat and corn, and it is indisputable that without sufficient food, survival is limited to mere weeks. As a result, agricultural lands are indispensable for human survival.\nFurthermore, individuals need shelters to shield themselves from natural elements such as wind, floods, and wild animals, hence land is necessary for constructing homes. Having a place to live is an essential human need, second only to food, and it's indisputable.\nLastly, humans require vital resources for survival, many of which are produced by industries, such as medicine. Thus, designating some land for industrial purposes is essential. Modern life presents challenges that are eased through industrial advancements.\nIn summary, the number of endangered species is far less than the human population, therefore they require significantly less land compared to humans.

{"id": "id_63", "input": "When deciding on a career, it's important to give it careful thought. Whether to pursue a career similar to one's parents' or not, people may have differing views. Personally, I believe opting for a job akin to one's parents' careers can be advantageous for one's professional growth. \nFirstly, since parents are immersed in the same professional setting, they can offer substantial assistance to their children, including specialized knowledge and industry-specific insights. For instance, my father is a software developer, and he has indeed imparted a lot of programming skills and computer knowledge to me. Whenever I encountered a challenge, I would consult him for advice. Since he possesses a wealth of experience, I could save a significant amount of time in finding solutions. This actually makes me more competitive than my peers. Had I chosen a different field from my father's, I would have encountered more difficulties than I currently do.\nHowever, given that parents have been working for decades, they have built an extensive network within a particular industry. They possess deep insights into the industry and can offer considerable support to their offspring. For example, they are aware of which companies offer superior benefits or educational opportunities. Furthermore, their industry contacts can even assist by writing recommendation letters to specific companies. It is undeniable that a strong recommendation letter holds immense value in today's competitive world. While others are still busy crafting their resumes, someone with a strong recommendation letter has already advanced past the initial stage of the interview process. \nSome might argue that with changing times, the job market conditions have drastically changed. As a result, choosing a career path similar to one's parents' isn't always the right choice. I partially agree with this perspective, but when it comes to trends, no one can accurately foresee them. The job market conditions change rapidly, almost instantaneously, making it so that there's no guarantee that a particular job will remain in demand for three decades or more.\nWhen contemplating whether to choose a career similar to one's parents', I have highlighted several reasons that someone can receive more assistance from their parents if they work in the same field.

Students can also engage in self-study at the library, concentrating solely on topics they find challenging. For instance, I have a close friend who was in the same department as me during university. She was able to grasp and comprehend classroom material rapidly. Consequently, she seldom attended classes, choosing to dedicate time to clarifying complex topics.

Based on my personal experience, I frequently skipped biology classes as my university didn't mandate attendance. Additionally, I had completed studying all biology topics prior to entering university. Therefore, I utilized the time allocated for biology classes to conduct Chemistry research, earning A+ in both subjects. \nIn conclusion, I believe students should be adept at identifying appropriate activities to engage in at any given time and effectively manage their study schedule.

As illustrated by the example above, focusing on your strengths increases your likelihood of fulfilling your goals.\nContinuously honing your strengths allows you to improve further. When you're good at something, you'll find greater satisfaction and interest in it. Consequently, you'll inspire yourself to achieve more.

{"id": "id_69", "input": "In many nations, artists enjoy the liberty to express their ideas through their work. However, some suggest that government regulations should be implemented to curtail their opinions. I, on the other hand, concur with this notion only partially and maintain that artists should be granted freedom to create truly outstanding masterpieces.\nTo begin with, if artists' ideas are controlled, they will inevitably lose their creative spark over time. It's clear that when allowed to express themselves, most artists will think innovatively and produce remarkable art forms like paintings or films. For instance, Da Vinci's and Michelangelo's artworks remain admired today as they were unrestricted in their time. In essence, without constraints, artists will create more breathtaking works.\nMoreover, it is a fundamental human right to express one's opinions, provided it does not harm the nation. many countries today strive to demonstrate their democratic values. art serves as a medium to critique social issues and government policies within a country. To further illustrate, the well-known film '3 Idiots' starring Aamir Khan critiques an education system focused on rote learning rather than practical application. Consequently, restricting artists' freedom of expression is a violation of human rights.\nFrom an alternative viewpoint, there are potential downsides if artists are left unchecked. They may delve into sensitive topics that could spark controversies within a nation. As an example, Malaysia is a multicultural nation where citizens coexist in harmony and peace. if sensitive racial issues are addressed in films or books, it might lead to societal unrest. Nevertheless, I am convinced that artists are aware of their limits and would not want to tarnish their reputations with reckless actions.\nIn conclusion, it is apparent that artists' work should not be subject to restrictions. Granting them creative freedom allows for personal expression as ideas can flow naturally without imposed limits. Therefore, despite potential negative impacts of unrestrained expression, I firmly believe that many extraordinary and beautiful artworks exist because of the freedom to express ideas and thus, I am strongly convinced artists should not face restrictions.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay081", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 264, "to": 338}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 355, "to": 445}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 463, "to": 592}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 608, "to": 707}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 721, "to": 785}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 797, "to": 892}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 894, "to": 960}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 962, "to": 1051}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1076, "to": 1215}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1231, "to": 1304}], "label": "Claim", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1398, "to": 1481}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1498, "to": 1576}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1578, "to": 1670}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1706, "to": 1809}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1846, "to": 1897}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1899, "to": 1960}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1964, "to": 2011}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2024, "to": 2085}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2109, "to": 2196}], "label": "Claim", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2231, "to": 2267}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 19}], "edges": [{"source": 4, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 17, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 4, 9, 12, 14, 18, 19]}
{"id": "id_70", "input": "Much has been discussed regarding the significance of having good roommates and how they influence our lives in school. Studies indicate that friendships formed in college are likely to be long-lasting, and this is especially true for those with roommates. Personally, the most crucial attribute of roommates is being considerate. At the same time, effective communication is another vital characteristic of a good roommate. \nConsideration is consistently essential in any relationship. For instance, a roommate lowers the volume of music or television at night. Occasionally, we remain unaware of our actions until we experience the consequences firsthand. Always reflecting on how others feel before engaging in self-centered behavior can greatly enhance the roommate relationship. Consequently, having a considerate roommate is enormously vital to our academic experience. It not only helps avoid disputes but also fosters the development of friendships or even familial bonds.\nFurthermore, communication equally contributes to being a good roommate. Individuals have varying daily habits, like straightening their blanket in the morning. One person might view this task as simple, while another might see it as a significant undertaking. If someone decides to move out just because their roommate doesn't tidy the blanket in the morning, it might be an overreaction. Thus, communication holds immense importance since it can resolve misunderstandings. Through communication, bonds are formed, leading to a deeper understanding of one another.\nIn summary, there are numerous valuable aspects of roommates that hold significance.

{"id": "id_73", "input": "When deciding where to live, public amenities and the environment are usually the primary considerations. Yet, finding a neighborhood that flawlessly suits our needs is challenging. In my hometown, the public services available nearly meet everyone's requirements, except for transportation. Thus, I strongly desire an increase in public transportation options. As a result, I encounter traffic congestion on a daily basis. And this issue seems to be worsening.\nInitially, there should be more options for public transportation, like subway or sky train systems. Therefore, individuals will have more alternatives to reach their destinations. Because currently, buses are the sole form of public transport in this area, This leaves residents with limited options. They are compelled to rely solely on buses for travel. The introduction of subways and sky trains would offer greater convenience. For instance, subway schedules allow people to predict travel times. Conversely, such predictability is absent with bus services. Furthermore, this enhancement will indirectly alleviate traffic congestion.\nSecondly, the buses only cover two routes in the area. This is undoubtedly a significant issue. For example, if my intended destination is not on a bus route, I must first travel to a central station and transfer to another bus. Clearly, it results in a considerable loss of time. They need to expand routes to facilitate easier transportation.\nLastly, increasing public transportation options can reduce the reliance on personal vehicles.

This trend is not only observed among wealthy students but also among those from less affluent backgrounds. During this gap of one or two years, some students choose to travel extensively, while others opt to work.\nThe experiences gained from traveling to various destinations, interacting with diverse people, and even working, are invaluable. This not only boosts a student's confidence but also fosters their independence. Students who work often accumulate better financial resources, which they can depend on during their university education. Such experiences also help them discover what direction they want their lives to take. They gain a wider perspective, allowing them to make more informed decisions about their future studies or courses.\nTaking a gap year has its advantages, but it also presents some drawbacks. Once students start earning, they may be reluctant to return to academia, where they would forfeit their financial autonomy. They might also struggle to readjust to an academic setting. There is a potential risk that students may never return to pursue a university or higher education. Some might opt for short-term courses instead of a full university education to secure better employment and salaries. However, this may only benefit them temporarily, as it's widely understood that a solid career in the long term requires proper and advanced qualifications.\nFrom my perspective, I support the idea of taking a break before beginning higher education.

{"id": "id_76", "input": "Nowadays, closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras are extensively utilized in various settings. They are employed in educational institutions, businesses, and other venues to observe ongoing activities. It's undeniable that CCTV usage brings numerous advantages, particularly in decreasing crime rates and ensuring employee safety. However, there are concerns that these cameras may invade personal privacy due to constant surveillance. Despite this, I firmly assert that CCTV cameras ought to be installed in every establishment to tackle the rising theft rates and to ensure the safety of employees.\nTo begin with, installing CCTV cameras in workplaces can help reduce crimes such as theft. This is because if a store is targeted by criminals, footage from these cameras can serve as evidence to track down the perpetrators. For instance, in Malaysia, law enforcement successfully used CCTV footage to track and apprehend a gang of thieves who broke into a Seven Eleven during the night. Moreover, knowing they are under surveillance, employees are less likely to steal from their employers. Therefore, it is evident that CCTV systems should be installed in all workplaces to help reduce crime rates.\nAdditionally, in some offices, employees frequently have to deal with irate or upset customers. Occasionally, interacting with a frustrated customer face-to-face can pose a physical threat to employees. Consequently, CCTV cameras can assist employees in avoiding such situations since customers are aware that their conversations are being recorded. In case of a dispute, video recordings can be used to clarify incidents and enable further action. In summary, these cameras offer a layer of protection for employees against customer-related incidents.\nOn the other hand, the deployment of CCTV cameras sparks debate. Critics of CCTV systems argue that constant monitoring infringes on their privacy. Nonetheless, it is crucial to recognize that safety takes precedence over privacy, and prevention is preferable to enduring the consequences. Thus, those against these systems should understand the context and take measures to avoid becoming crime victims.\nIn conclusion, CCTV cameras are vital and should be installed in every facility. This is primarily to protect individuals from potential harm by intruders or thieves. While it's true that the use of these cameras compromises privacy.

In my view, I believe that opting for a career path similar to one's parents can be advantageous for one's professional journey. \nFirstly, since parents are familiar with the same professional environment, they can offer substantial support to their children, such as expert knowledge and industry-specific insights. For instance, my father is a software developer, and he has indeed taught me a great deal about coding and computer science. Whenever I encountered a challenge, I would consult him for advice. Because he possesses a wealth of experience, I could significantly reduce the time spent searching for solutions. This gives me a competitive edge over my colleagues. Had I chosen a career in a different field from my father, I would have faced greater challenges than I do now.\nHowever, considering parents have spent decades in their professions, they have built a substantial network within a particular industry. They possess deep insights and can offer significant assistance to their children. For example, they are aware of which companies offer better benefits or educational opportunities. Additionally, their industry peers can even assist by writing recommendation letters for specific companies. It is undeniable that a strong recommendation letter is crucial in today's competitive job market. While others are still busy preparing their resumes, someone with a stellar recommendation letter has already advanced past the initial interview stage. \nSome might contend that as times have changed, the job market conditions have changed drastically.

{"id": "id_79", "input": "The debate on whether affluent countries should take on the responsibility of assisting poorer nations by providing infrastructure, or simply remain passive observers of global poverty, is quite contentious. Personally, I believe that as the fortunate few, wealthy countries have every justification to distribute their wealth to those less fortunate.\nFrom an ethical standpoint, it is heartless to witness others suffer from hunger and poverty without extending a helping hand, particularly when doing so requires little effort from the observer. Compassion, a value emphasized in nearly all faiths from Buddhism to Islam, is what sets humans apart from animals.\nEconomically, such assistance can also lead to mutually beneficial outcomes. There is no doubt that underdeveloped countries gain immediate advantages from such actions. For developed countries, new medical issues might emerge from engaging with underdeveloped regions; hence, this triggers relevant research to address the issues, encouraging growth in the pharmaceutical sector. The potential market in these impoverished countries, many of which have large populations, is also noteworthy.

Learners can also gain insights from experiences, libraries, and others. In my opinion, attending classes should be a choice for students for several reasons.\nFirstly, one reason university students shouldn't be obligated to attend classes is that often, university students can gain a deeper understanding from resources outside the classroom. Students can engage in self-study at the library, concentrating on topics they find challenging. For instance, I have a close friend who was in the same department with me at university. She had a knack for quickly grasping everything taught in class. Consequently, she seldom attended classes, choosing instead to focus on topics she found confusing. Ultimately, she graduated with excellent grades.\nSecondly, students should have the option not to attend classes because they can allocate time spent on classes to other beneficial activities if they have a solid grasp of the class topics. Based on my experience, on numerous occasions, I skipped biology class since my university didn't mandate attendance. Additionally, I had already covered all the biology topics before starting university. Therefore, I used the time during biology class for my Chemistry research and achieved an A+ in both subjects. \nIn summary, I believe students need to be aware of the activities they should prioritize and manage their study time effectively.

{"id": "id_84", "input": "In most nations, artists are granted the liberty to articulate their thoughts in various forms. However, some contend that government-imposed restrictions are necessary to limit their expressions. I, on the other hand, only partially agree with this and think that artists should be allowed freedom so they can create truly remarkable masterpieces.\nTo begin with, if there is regulation over artists' ideas, they will inevitably lose their creative edge over time. It is indisputable that when given the chance to express themselves, most artists will think creatively and produce outstanding works like paintings or films. For instance, paintings by Da Vinci and Michelangelo are still praised today because they were not restricted during their time. In essence, without restrictions, we are likely to see more inspiring creations from our artists.\nMoreover, it is a fundamental human right to express opinions in any form as long as it does not harm the nation. Today, numerous countries strive to demonstrate their democratic nature. Art is a medium that can be used to critique societal issues and government policies in a particular country. To further illustrate, the renowned film '3 Idiots' starring Aamir Khan criticizes the education system, which focuses primarily on rote learning rather than practical application. Consequently, it violates human rights if artists are not permitted to express their emotions freely.\nFrom a different angle, there are potential downsides if artists operate without restrictions. They might delve into certain topics that could spark controversy within a country. For example, Malaysia is a diverse nation where all citizens coexist peacefully. If anyone raises sensitive issues in films or books concerning any ethnic groups, it could lead to social unrest. Nonetheless, I maintain that artists are well aware of their limits and would certainly avoid tarnishing their reputations with reckless actions.\nIn conclusion, it is clear that artists' work should not be subjected to restrictions. Granting them the freedom to think independently allows them to express themselves as ideas can flow naturally when there are no constraints. Therefore, even though the freedom to express ideas can have some negative consequences, I firmly believe that there are numerous extraordinary and beautiful works of art thanks to the freedom to express ideas and thus, I am convinced there should be no restrictions imposed on them.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay081", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 265, "to": 347}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 364, "to": 463}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 489, "to": 622}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 638, "to": 751}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 765, "to": 849}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 861, "to": 963}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 965, "to": 1036}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1038, "to": 1146}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1171, "to": 1327}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1343, "to": 1429}], "label": "Claim", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1526, "to": 1608}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1623, "to": 1689}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1691, "to": 1803}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1834, "to": 1949}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1983, "to": 2036}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2038, "to": 2120}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2124, "to": 2178}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2191, "to": 2267}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2291, "to": 2389}], "label": "Claim", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2415, "to": 2462}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 19}], "edges": [{"source": 4, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 17, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 4, 9, 12, 14, 18, 19]}

A professor is essentially a researcher or a specialist in a particular academic discipline. It is crucial for them to maintain enthusiasm in their area of expertise so that they can continuously drive themselves to advance.

All my classmates rated him AAA, acknowledging him as an outstanding teacher.\nStudents can find information from textbooks, the internet, or instructors. However, we rely on professors when we want to engage in research and advance our knowledge. if a professor is not involved in research, they cannot provide us with such opportunities.

It's important to acknowledge that art invariably encompasses imagination, exaggeration, and at times, complete fabrication; irrespective of whether an artwork is grounded in reality, it is up to the public to decide its interpretation. If the art portrays falsehoods, the public certainly has the insight to identify its lack of truth and can appreciate solely its artistic value; if the art mirrors reality, then what would be the motive behind prohibiting it unless it's to conceal unpleasant truths? Wouldn't it be authoritarian if the government silences artists who reveal the truth? In summary, the fear of societal deception is unfounded.\nLet's then consider the influence that art has on people.

Nonetheless, finding a community that perfectly fits our desires can be quite challenging. In my hometown, nearly all essential public services are available, except for efficient transportation options. Thus, what I genuinely wish to improve is the availability of public transportation options. This is particularly important because I encounter traffic jams on a daily basis. This issue seems to be worsening. \nInitially, there should be more choices for public transit, like subway or sky train. Consequently, individuals will have more alternatives for reaching their destinations. Given that currently, buses are the sole form of public transit in this area, This leaves residents here with limited options. They are compelled to rely exclusively on buses to travel elsewhere. Having subways and sky trains would enhance convenience for them. For instance, people can predict travel time using subway schedules. Conversely, predicting travel times is not possible with buses. Furthermore, this enhancement will indirectly alleviate road congestion. \nSecondly, the buses only provide two routes within this locality. This is undeniably a significant issue. For example, if my desired destination is not on the bus route, I have to take a bus to the central station before switching to another bus. Clearly, it results in wasted time. Additional routes should be added to facilitate easier transportation for the populace.\nLastly, introducing more public transport options can reduce the number of personal car users. Besides, it offers numerous benefits. For instance, people can cut costs on fuel, which is becoming more expensive. Essential energy resources will gradually be conserved, as individuals rely less on their own vehicles.\nIn conclusion, transportation is a fundamental aspect that directly impacts people's lifestyles.

It is indisputable that CCTV usage offers numerous advantages, particularly in curbing crime and safeguarding employees on the premises. However, some contend that these cameras infringe on their privacy due to the constant surveillance. Despite this, I firmly assert that CCTV cameras should be installed in every location to tackle the rising theft rates and ensure the safety of workers at their job sites.\nTo begin with, having CCTV cameras in workplaces can significantly reduce incidents of crimes like robbery. This is because when a store is targeted by criminals, footage from these cameras provides crucial evidence to track down the culprits. For instance, in Malaysia, police utilized CCTV footage to identify and apprehend a gang of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven store during the night. Furthermore, knowing they are under continuous observation, employees are less inclined to steal from the establishments. Therefore, it becomes evident that CCTVs should be installed in all workplaces to help lower crime rates.\nIn addition, in some offices, employees often need to deal with irate or upset customers. Occasionally, face-to-face interactions with displeased customers can put employees at physical risk. Consequently, the presence of CCTV cameras can assist employees in avoiding such dangerous situations since customers are well aware that their interactions are being recorded. In case of disputes, the video recordings can be reviewed to understand what transpired, allowing for appropriate actions to be taken. In essence, these cameras can offer a layer of protection for workers against customers.\nFrom another angle, the deployment of CCTV cameras does spark debate. Critics of CCTV systems argue that their privacy is compromised due to constant monitoring. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that safety is more crucial than privacy, and prevention is preferable to facing negative outcomes. Hence, those who oppose the system should strive to understand the situation and take steps to avoid becoming crime victims.\nIn summary, CCTV cameras are vital and should therefore be installed in every setting. The main purpose is to protect individuals from potential harm by intruders or thieves.

{"id": "id_93", "input": "When it comes to selecting a career, it's crucial to ponder over the decision carefully. Whether to opt for a profession that mirrors that of one's parents is a subject on which people may have varying views. Personally, I am of the view that pursuing a career similar to one's parents can positively impact one's professional journey. \nTo begin with, since parents have experience in the same field, they can offer substantial guidance, including specialized knowledge and industry-specific insights. Take, for instance, my father works as a software developer, and he has taught me a lot about programming and computer systems. Whenever I encounter challenges, I consult him for advice. Since he possesses extensive experience, I am able to save significant time when seeking solutions. This gives me a competitive edge over my peers. Had I chosen a different sector from my father, I would have encountered greater challenges than I do now.\nOn the other hand, given that parents have spent decades in their profession, they have built a substantial network within a specific industry. They possess profound insights and can offer valuable support to their children. For example, they are aware of which companies offer superior benefits or training. Additionally, their industry acquaintances might even assist in drafting recommendation letters for specific firms. It's undeniable that a strong recommendation letter holds immense importance in today's competitive environment. When others are still crafting their resumes, someone with a compelling recommendation letter has already cleared the initial interview hurdle. \nSome might contend that as times have changed, the employment landscape has shifted dramatically. Thus, choosing a career akin to one's parents' is not always the best decision. I partially agree with this perspective, yet when considering trends, predicting them accurately is nearly impossible. The job market evolves at an astonishing pace, which means it is unpredictable whether any profession will remain popular for three decades or more.\nIn weighing whether choosing a career akin to one's parents is a wise decision, I've highlighted several reasons why individuals can receive greater assistance from their parents if they work within the same sector.

Students also gain insights through various means such as experiences, libraries, and interactions with others. Personally, I believe attending classes should be a choice rather than a requirement for students for the following reasons.\nTo begin with, the rationale for not mandating class attendance for university students is there are instances where university students can acquire knowledge more effectively from alternative sources outside the classroom. students have the opportunity to self-study at the library, honing in on topics they find challenging. For instance, I have a close friend who was in the same university department as me. she grasped concepts swiftly and comprehended everything taught in class with ease. Consequently, she seldom attended classes, opting instead to focus on areas she found perplexing. Ultimately, she graduated with exceptionally high grades.\nMoreover, another reason why students shouldn\u2019t be compelled to attend classes is students can allocate the time spent in classes to engage in other productive activities if they have already mastered the class material. From my personal experience, I frequently skipped biology classes as my university did not enforce attendance. Additionally, I had covered all biology topics before enrolling in university. Therefore, I utilized the biology class hours for my chemistry research, ultimately earning A+ in both subjects. \nTo sum up, I contend that students should be adept at deciding which activities to prioritize and managing their study time efficiently.

It is indisputable that when artists are afforded the chance to freely express themselves, they tend to think innovatively and produce remarkable works such as paintings and films. For instance, artworks by Da Vinci and Michelangelo continue to be revered because they were unrestricted during their time. In essence, the absence of constraints fosters the creation of astonishing works by our artists.\nMoreover, it is a fundamental human right to articulate one's opinions in any manner, provided it does not incite national unrest. today, numerous nations strive to prove their democratic nature. art serves as a medium to critique societal issues and governmental policies within a country. To provide a clearer picture, the renowned movie '3 Idiots', starring Amir Khan, critiques an education system focused on rote learning rather than practical application. Therefore, the infringement of human rights occurs if artists are prohibited from expressing their emotions freely.\nFrom a different angle, there are certain drawbacks if artists operate without constraints. artists might delve into subjects that spark controversy within a nation.

{"id": "id_100", "input": "There's been much discussion about the significance of having good roommates and how they can impact our school life. Studies indicate that friendships formed in university often turn into lifelong connections, and this is especially true for roommates. In my view, the most vital trait of a roommate is thoughtfulness. Meanwhile, effective communication is another crucial attribute of a good roommate. \nBeing considerate is consistently crucial in relationships. For instance, a roommate lowers the volume of music or television at night. Occasionally, we don't realize what we've done until we experience it ourselves. Consistently considering the other person's feelings before engaging in self-centered actions can greatly enhance the roommate relationship. Thus, having a considerate roommate is extremely important for our academic life. It not only helps avoid conflicts but also fosters friendships or even familial bonds.\nFurthermore, communication is equally essential in forming a good roommate relationship. Individuals have varying daily habits, such as making the bed each morning. One person might see this as a breeze, while another could view it as a daunting task. Requesting to move out simply because a roommate doesn't make the bed in the morning could be seen as an overreaction. Hence, communication plays a crucial role since it helps to resolve misunderstandings. By communicating, bonds are formed, and we gain a better understanding of each other.\nIn summary, there are numerous valuable traits in a roommate that hold significance. In my opinion, thoughtfulness and communication are the most essential qualities. Nonetheless, it's not always possible to get exactly what we desire.

{"id": "id_101", "input": "While professors at universities primarily serve as educators, imparting knowledge is undoubtedly crucial. However, we must not overlook another significant responsibility they shoulder: conducting research. I believe that professors ought to dedicate more time to research than to teaching students for several reasons outlined below.\nA professor is inherently a researcher or a specialist in a particular academic discipline. They should consistently maintain enthusiasm for their area of expertise, enabling they can continually advance and develop themselves. Furthermore, this, in turn, improves their teaching capabilities. For example, the most remarkable professor I encountered during my university years was Mr. Yang, who was dedicated to ongoing research and reading. He was also the one who inspired us and taught us how to learn more effectively on our own. All my classmates rated him as an AAA, an outstanding teacher.\nStudents can obtain the information they seek from textbooks, websites, or instructors. However, we rely on professors when we wish to engage in research and further our personal development. If a professor isn't involved in research, they can't offer us these opportunities. Moreover, a professor deeply immersed in their research is constantly generating new ideas. They might inspire us students to propose innovative suggestions. This benefits both the professor and the students.\nUltimately, professors at universities are invaluable assets to society. They are pioneers in various domains of science, arts, culture, and more. Without their research, new technologies wouldn't emerge rapidly. Without their research, more artistic creations would be lost to neglect. Without their research, our knowledge about ancestors would be significantly limited.\nIn summary, professors should consistently engage in research throughout their teaching careers at universities.

It goes without saying that art inherently involves imagination, exaggeration, and sometimes is entirely fictitious; whether a piece is grounded in reality or not, it is up to the public to decide its interpretation. If art depicts the unreal, the audience certainly has the insight to recognize its falsehood and appreciate its artistic merit; if art mirrors reality, then why would there be an intention to suppress it unless to conceal the unpleasant truth?

Nevertheless, finding a community that perfectly fulfills all our criteria is challenging. In my hometown, the public utilities are nearly complete, except for transportation. Therefore, the aspect I truly wish to change is the availability of more public transportation. Because I encounter traffic jams daily. And this issue seems to be worsening. \nInitially, there should be more options like a subway or sky train. Consequently, individuals will have additional means to reach their destinations. Given that currently, buses are the sole form of public transportation in this area, This leaves residents with no alternatives. They are compelled to rely solely on buses for travel. If a subway and sky train were introduced, it would offer greater convenience. For instance, people can predict travel time with the subway due to its schedule. Conversely, this is not feasible with buses. Additionally, this enhancement will indirectly alleviate road congestion. \nSecondly, the buses service only two routes within the community. This clearly poses a significant issue. For example, if the place I aim to visit isn't on the bus route, I must first travel to the central station to switch buses. Clearly, this results in a waste of time. More routes should be added to facilitate easier travel.\nFinally, expanding public transport options can reduce the number of people relying on personal vehicles. Furthermore, it offers numerous benefits. For example, people can cut down on fuel costs, which are increasingly rising. Essential energy resources will be conserved, because people drive their personal cars less frequently.\nIn conclusion, transportation is a fundamental element that directly impacts people's livelihoods.

Therefore, this could harm their mental and physical well-being.\nAnother point is that jobs can distract students from their academic pursuits. If students start earning money at a young age, they might become attracted to financial gain. They may feel independent and choose to work more for money. This could detract from their academic interests. Furthermore, they might abandon their studies to earn more money.\nMoreover, the primary disadvantage of teen employment is missing out on the joys of childhood.

{"id": "id_106", "input": "Today, closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras are extensively utilized in various situations. They are installed in schools, businesses, and other locations to observe ongoing activities. It is undeniable that CCTV usage offers numerous advantages, particularly in reducing crime and ensuring employee safety at a site. However, some individuals claim that these cameras infringe upon their privacy due to constant observation. Despite this, I am firmly convinced that CCTV cameras should be installed in all premises to tackle the rising theft rates and to safeguard workers at their workplaces.\nFirstly, installing CCTV cameras at the workplace can help reduce crimes like theft. This is because when a store is targeted by robbers, footage from these cameras provides evidence to track down the culprits. For instance, in Malaysia, police officers used CCTV footage to track and apprehend a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven store at midnight. Moreover, knowing they are being watched, employees are less likely to steal from the stores. Therefore, it is evident that CCTVs should be installed in every workplace to help lower crime rates.\nAdditionally, in certain offices, employees frequently deal with irate or upset customers. Sometimes, dealing directly with an angry customer can pose physical risks to employees. Consequently, having CCTV cameras in place can assist employees in avoiding such dangers since customers are aware that their interactions are being recorded. In case of a dispute, video recordings can clarify what occurred, allowing for appropriate measures to be taken. In summary, these cameras offer a layer of protection for workers against customer aggression.\nFrom an alternative viewpoint, employing CCTV cameras does spark debate. Critics of CCTV systems believe their privacy is compromised by constant surveillance. Nonetheless, it is crucial to acknowledge that safety is more important than privacy, and preventing issues is preferable to dealing with their aftermath. Thus, those who oppose this system should understand the significance and take steps to protect themselves from crime.\nIn conclusion, CCTV cameras are vital and should be installed in all premises. The primary goal is to protect against potential harm from intruders or thieves. While it is true that privacy is compromised with the presence of these cameras. Nevertheless, prioritizing safety is essential for ensuring security.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay085", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 471, "to": 597}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 608, "to": 682}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 700, "to": 808}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 824, "to": 960}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 972, "to": 1054}], "label": "Premise", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1086, "to": 1156}], "label": "Claim", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1172, "to": 1247}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1260, "to": 1336}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1352, "to": 1426}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1433, "to": 1495}], "label": "Premise", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1519, "to": 1608}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1622, "to": 1703}], "label": "Claim", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1778, "to": 1863}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1878, "to": 2018}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2026, "to": 2137}], "label": "Premise", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2154, "to": 2216}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2218, "to": 2297}], "label": "Claim", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2321, "to": 2378}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2394, "to": 2448}], "label": "Premise", "id": 18}], "edges": [{"source": 5, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 16, "target": 17, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 17, "target": 18, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 5, 11, 12, 15, 16]}

We require agricultural land to cultivate essential crops like wheat and corn, and undoubtedly, without food, survival beyond a few weeks is impossible. Consequently, farmlands are indispensable for human survival.\nAdditionally, individuals need shelter to shield themselves from natural elements such as wind, floods, and wild animals, which means land is essential for constructing homes. Housing is an undeniable necessity for humans, second only to food.\nLastly, humans require certain vital resources to sustain life, many of which are manufactured, like medicine. As a result, a portion of land needs to be allocated for industrial purposes. Modern life presents challenges that are eased through industrial advancements. \nIn summary, the population of endangered species is significantly smaller than that of humans, implying they require far less land compared to human needs.

Personally, I believe opting for a profession akin to that of one's parents can be advantageous for one's career. \nTo begin with, since parents are familiar with the same field, they can offer substantial support to their children, including expertise and industry-specific insights. For instance, my father is a software programmer, and he has imparted significant programming skills and computer knowledge to me. Whenever I encounter a challenge, I seek his advice. Given that he possesses extensive experience, I can save a tremendous amount of time in finding solutions. This genuinely gives me an edge over my peers. If I ventured into a different field than my father, I would encounter greater challenges than I currently face.\nHowever, considering parents have spent decades working, they have built an extensive network within a specific industry. They possess deep insights and can offer substantial support to their children. For example, they know which companies offer superior benefits or educational opportunities. Additionally, their acquaintances in the industry can even assist in writing recommendation letters for certain companies.

Therefore, I firmly believe that you should concentrate on your strengths.\nConcentrating on your strengths aids in achieving your objectives. Undoubtedly, the more you invest time in your strengths, the greater your chances of achieving remarkable outcomes. For example, Albert Einstein, recognized as one of the most skilled physicists in history, dedicated the majority of his life to developing theories in physics, ultimately founding the special and general relativity. On the contrary, he paid little attention to other matters. It is noted that, astonishingly, he never bothered to differentiate between hand soap and facial soap, because, at least for him, using two different types of soap was quite bothersome for him. As the aforementioned example demonstrates, focusing on your strengths increases the likelihood of fulfilling your goals.\nBy continuously engaging in activities you're already good at, you can enhance your skills. When you excel at something, you experience greater satisfaction and a deeper interest in it. Subsequently, this will inspire you to pursue more. To illustrate, During junior high, I excelled in mathematics. Since I was genuinely pleased with my ability to perform well, I immersed myself in tackling more advanced math problems.

{"id": "id_114", "input": "In many countries, artists enjoy the liberty to express their thoughts through their creations. However, some believe that the government should impose restrictions to regulate their viewpoints. Personally, I partially support this notion, but I firmly believe that artists should be granted the freedom to create extraordinary masterpieces.\nTo begin with, placing restrictions on artists' ideas would inevitably stifle their creativity over time. It is clear that when given the freedom to express themselves, artists often think innovatively and produce remarkable works such as paintings or films. For instance, paintings by Da Vinci and Michelangelo continue to be admired today because they were not constrained during their era. To summarize, greater freedom will lead to more breathtaking creations from artists.\nAdditionally, every individual has the right to express their opinions in any form, provided it does not disrupt national harmony. many nations today strive to demonstrate their commitment to being democratic. Moreover, art serves as a medium to critique societal issues and government policies within a country. As an example, the renowned movie '3 Idiots' starring Aamir Khan highlights flaws in the education system, which centers on rote learning rather than practical application. Therefore, prohibiting artists from expressing themselves freely infringes on fundamental human rights.\nOn the flip side, there are certain disadvantages if artists are left unrestricted. artists might delve into sensitive topics that could provoke controversies within a nation. For example, Malaysia, as a multiracial society, thrives on peace and harmony among its citizens. if an artist addresses sensitive racial issues in their works, it could potentially spark societal unrest. Despite this, I am convinced that artists are typically aware of their limits and would avoid tarnishing their reputations through unethical actions.\nIn conclusion, it is evident that artistic expression should not be subjected to restrictions. granting them creative freedom allows artists to articulate their ideas effectively because ideas flow more naturally when there are no constraints. Thus, while unrestricted expression might occasionally have negative consequences, I wholeheartedly believe that the freedom to express ideas has given rise to countless extraordinary works of art and ultimately, I strongly assert artists should be allowed to work without restrictions.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay081", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 266, "to": 340}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 357, "to": 446}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 465, "to": 599}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 615, "to": 733}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 749, "to": 818}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 834, "to": 949}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 951, "to": 1028}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1040, "to": 1131}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1148, "to": 1304}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1317, "to": 1408}], "label": "Claim", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1494, "to": 1584}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1599, "to": 1682}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1684, "to": 1789}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1825, "to": 1939}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1975, "to": 2034}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2036, "to": 2119}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2128, "to": 2183}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2191, "to": 2266}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2298, "to": 2381}], "label": "Claim", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2416, "to": 2470}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 19}], "edges": [{"source": 4, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 17, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 4, 9, 12, 14, 18, 19]}

Nonetheless, finding a community that perfectly aligns with our criteria is challenging. In my hometown, nearly all public utilities are available, except for adequate transportation options. Therefore, what I truly wish to see improved is the availability of more public transportation. Given that I encounter traffic jams daily. And this issue seems to be worsening. \nFirstly, there should be more options for public transportation, like subways or elevated trains. Consequently, people will have a greater variety of ways to reach their destinations. Since currently, buses are the sole form of public transportation in this area, This leaves residents with no alternatives. They are compelled to rely solely on buses to travel elsewhere. Introducing subways and elevated trains would greatly enhance convenience for them. For instance, people can plan their time better using subway schedules. Conversely, this is not possible with buses. Moreover, such an improvement would indirectly alleviate road traffic issues. \nSecondly, the buses offer only two routes in this area. This constitutes a significant issue. For example, if my destination isn't on the bus route, I must first take a bus to the central station and then switch to another bus. Clearly, this leads to a considerable loss of time. More routes should be added to facilitate easier transportation for people.\nFinally, increasing the types of public transportation can reduce the number of people driving their own cars. Additionally, it offers numerous benefits. For example, individuals can cut down on gasoline expenses, which are rising. The demand for essential energy will gradually diminish, because people rely less on their personal vehicles.\nIn conclusion, transportation is a fundamental factor that significantly impacts people's lives.

This trend is not limited to wealthy students but is also observed among those from less affluent backgrounds. During this time, students may spend a year or two traveling globally or opt to enter the workforce.\nThe insights gained from exploring various places, interacting with diverse individuals, and working are immensely valuable. Such experiences boost a student's self-assurance and foster independence. Students who take up jobs tend to accumulate financial savings that can support them during their university years. These experiences provide clarity on their life aspirations.

Once students start earning, they might be reluctant to return to academics, sacrificing their financial autonomy. They may face challenges in readjusting to the academic setting. There is also the possibility that students may never return to pursue higher education. Some might opt for short-term courses over a full university degree, aiming for better job prospects and salaries. This approach might only benefit them temporarily, as it's widely recognized that a solid career requires comprehensive qualifications.\nFrom my perspective, I support the notion of pausing before commencing higher education.

It shifts their focus away from academics and deprives them of the joys of childhood.\nIn today's competitive environment, students are required to study extensively to succeed. They need to dedicate a significant portion of their time to school to achieve high grades. If students spend their remaining time working, it imposes additional stress on them.

They might not have sufficient time for rest and sleep. Consequently, this can have detrimental effects on their mental and physical well-being.\nFurthermore, Jobs can distract students from their educational pursuits. Earning money at a young age can draw students towards financial gain. They may feel self-sufficient and choose to prioritize earning over studying. This can negatively impact their academic interest and commitment. Moreover, They may opt to leave their studies to increase their earnings.\nBesides, The primary drawback of teenage employment is missing out on the enjoyable aspects of childhood. They would miss out on childhood activities, such as socializing with friends, participating in clubs, and engaging in fun and social interactions.

{"id": "id_121", "input": "Nowadays, closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras have become prevalent in numerous settings. They are utilized in educational institutions, commercial enterprises, and various other facilities for observing ongoing activities. Undoubtedly, the deployment of CCTV offers numerous advantages, notably in curbing criminal activities and safeguarding employees within a premise. However, some contend that these cameras infringe on their privacy due to continuous observation. Despite this, I am firmly convinced that CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace.\nTo begin with, by having CCTV cameras at workplace, crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down. This is due to the fact that when a shop is attacked by thieves, the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced. For instance, in Malaysia, policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight. Moreover, as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance, they will less likely steal from the shops. Consequently, it is evident that CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized.\nIn addition, at some offices, employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers. Occasionally, face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger. Therefore, the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation because the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded. In case of a dispute, the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken. In essence, these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers.\nConsidering another viewpoint, the use of CCTV cameras indeed sparks debate. Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras. Nonetheless, one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences. Consequently, opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime.\nIn summary, CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise. This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers. It is acknowledged that privacies are lost with the use of these cameras.

{"id": "id_123", "input": "When deciding on a career, it's crucial to deliberate carefully. The question of whether to pursue a career path similar to one's parents elicits varied opinions from different individuals. Personally, I believe that opting for a career akin to one's parents' can be advantageous for one's professional journey. \nFirstly, since parents are familiar with the same professional environment, they can offer substantial support to their children, including expertise and industry-specific insights. For instance, my father is a software developer, and he has taught me extensively about programming and computer skills. Whenever I encounter a challenge, I seek his advice. Because he possesses a wealth of experience, I can save a significant amount of time in problem-solving. This genuinely gives me an edge over my peers. If I were working in a field different from my father's, I would face greater challenges than I do now.\nHowever, considering that parents have decades of experience, they have built a robust network within a specific industry. They possess deep insights and can significantly support their children. For example, they are aware of which companies offer superior benefits or educational opportunities. Furthermore, their colleagues within the same field can even assist by writing recommendation letters for certain companies. It is undeniable that a strong recommendation letter is incredibly valuable in today's competitive world. While others are still preparing their resumes, someone with a solid recommendation letter has already moved past the initial phase of the interview process. \nSome might contend that, given the changing times, the job market conditions have changed drastically. Therefore, opting for a career similar to one's parents' isn't always the right choice. I partially agree with this view, yet when it comes to predicting trends, it's impossible to be accurate. The job market evolves at a rapid pace, making it difficult to ensure that there's no guarantee that any job will remain in demand for 30 years or more.\nIn evaluating whether one should follow a career similar to their parents', I've discussed several reasons that one can receive more guidance from their parents if they work in the same industry.

{"id": "id_124", "input": "The debate around whether affluent countries should assist poorer ones by investing in infrastructure or simply ignore the global poverty issue is contentious. In my view, as the fortunate few, wealthy nations have ample reasons to share their prosperity with less fortunate countries.\nFrom an ethical standpoint, it is cruel to witness others battling hunger and poverty without taking action, especially when it requires little effort from the observer. Empathy, a quality advocated by nearly all religions from Buddhism to Islam, is what sets humans apart from animals.\nFrom an economic perspective, such assistance can lead to mutual benefits. Less developed countries undoubtedly gain direct advantages through such actions. For advanced nations, new health challenges may arise from their efforts in less developed areas, and therefore research is conducted accordingly to tackle these issues, fostering growth in the pharmaceutical sector. The potential market in poorer countries, many of which have large populations, is also noteworthy.

Nevertheless, classes are not the sole avenue for acquiring knowledge. Students also gain insights from various other sources, including personal experiences, libraries, and interactions with others. In my opinion, attending classes should be a matter of choice for students for the following reasons.\nTo begin with, the reason why university students shouldn't be compelled to attend classes is students often find they can absorb information more effectively from sources outside the classroom. Students have the opportunity to study independently in the library, concentrating exclusively on the subjects they find challenging. For instance, I have a good friend who was in the same academic department as I was during university. She had a knack for quickly grasping and comprehending everything discussed in class. Consequently, she seldom attended lectures but dedicated her time to mastering complex topics. Ultimately, she achieved outstanding grades upon graduation.\nAdditionally, students shouldn't be mandated to attend lectures because students can allocate the time spent on classes to pursue other worthwhile endeavors if they are already well-versed in the class material. Based on my personal experience, frequently, I skipped my biology classes because my university does not enforce attendance requirements. Furthermore, I had already mastered all biology topics before enrolling in university. Therefore, I utilized my biology class time to focus on my Chemistry research, ultimately earning A+ in both subjects. \nIn summary, I believe students need to be aware of which activities they should prioritize and effectively manage their study time.

This approach could broaden your experiences, help you explore your personality, and unearth hidden talents. However, it doesn't always lead to success. If it doesn't, you might miss out on opportunities to achieve other goals. For this reason, I strongly assert that you should concentrate on your strengths.\nConcentrating on your strengths assists in achieving your objectives. Undoubtedly, the more effort you put into your strengths, the greater your chances of achieving excellence. For example, Albert Einstein, one of the most brilliant physicists in history, dedicated most of his life to developing theories in physics and eventually formulated the special and general theories of relativity. Conversely, he paid little attention to other matters. It is reported that, surprisingly, he couldn't differentiate between hand soap and facial soap, as, at least in his case, using two distinct soaps correctly was quite bothersome. As demonstrated in the aforementioned example, focusing on your strengths increases the likelihood of fulfilling your goals.\nContinuing to work on what you already excel at allows you to improve further. When you excel at something, you experience greater satisfaction and interest. Subsequently, this will inspire you to pursue more. To illustrate, I was proficient in math during my junior high school years. Since I took pride in my ability to perform well, I became deeply engaged in tackling more advanced math problems.

{"id": "id_129", "input": "In most nations, artists enjoy the liberty to convey their thoughts through their craft. However, some contend that government-imposed limitations should be placed to curb their expressions. I, on the other hand, only partially agree and assert that artists should have the freedom to create, which can lead to the production of truly outstanding masterpieces.\nTo begin with, imposing restrictions on artists' creativity could stifle their imaginative abilities over time. It is irrefutable that when granted the freedom to express, most artists will engage in innovative thinking and produce remarkable art like paintings or films. For instance, works by Da Vinci and Michelangelo continue to be revered because they were not constrained in their era. In essence, more inspiring works of art will emerge from artists if there are no restrictions.\nMoreover, every individual has the right to express their views in any form, provided they do not cause societal harm. Today, numerous countries strive to demonstrate their commitment to democracy. art serves as a medium to critique societal issues and governmental policies within a country. To further illustrate, the widely acclaimed film '3 Idiots', featuring Aamir Khan, critiques the education system focused on rote learning rather than practical application. Hence, restricting artists from expressing their emotions freely infringes on human rights.\nFrom another angle, drawbacks arise if artists operate without restrictions. artists might delve into topics that could spark controversies within a country. For example, Malaysia is a multi-ethnic nation where citizens coexist peacefully. If sensitive racial issues are addressed in films or books, it could lead to societal unrest. Nonetheless, it is my belief that artists are generally aware of their limits and would avoid damaging their reputations through reckless actions.\nIn conclusion, it is clear now that artists' work should not be subject to restrictions. Granting them the freedom to think enables them to express themselves fully since ideas can flow more naturally without constraints. Therefore, despite the potential negative impacts of unrestrained expression, I firmly assert that we have many exquisite pieces of art thanks to the liberty of expression and thus, I am strongly convinced artists should remain unrestricted.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay081", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 250, "to": 359}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 376, "to": 471}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 496, "to": 631}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 647, "to": 751}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 765, "to": 846}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 858, "to": 965}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 967, "to": 1044}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1046, "to": 1139}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1164, "to": 1313}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1322, "to": 1405}], "label": "Claim", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1484, "to": 1563}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1578, "to": 1645}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1647, "to": 1739}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1775, "to": 1886}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1924, "to": 1975}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1977, "to": 2052}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2059, "to": 2108}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2121, "to": 2186}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2209, "to": 2281}], "label": "Claim", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2316, "to": 2350}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 19}], "edges": [{"source": 4, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 17, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 4, 9, 12, 14, 18, 19]}

Studies indicate that friendships formed during university often last a lifetime, which is particularly true when it comes to roommates. Personally, being considerate is the most vital trait in a roommate. At the same time, effective communication is another crucial characteristic of a good roommate. \nBeing considerate is consistently crucial in relationships. For instance, a roommate lowers the music or TV volume during nighttime. There are times when we become aware of our actions only after we experience them ourselves. Always thinking about the other person's feelings before engaging in any self-centered activity can greatly enhance the roommate relationship. Consequently, having a thoughtful roommate is incredibly crucial for our academic life. This not only avoids conflicts but also fosters friendships or even familial bonds.\nAdditionally, communication also plays a significant role in forming a good roommate relationship. Individuals have varying daily habits, like straightening the blanket in the morning. For one person, this might be a simple task, while for another, it might seem like a massive undertaking. If someone chooses to move out solely because their roommate doesn't tidy the blanket, it may be an overreaction. As a result, communication holds great importance, as it helps resolve misunderstandings. Through communication, connections are formed that enhance mutual understanding.\nTo sum up, there are numerous valuable aspects of having a roommate that hold importance.

I believe that professors should prioritize research over teaching students for several reasons outlined below.\nA professor is essentially a researcher or specialist in a particular scientific discipline. They must continually nurture a passion for their field so that they can consistently drive their own progress. Furthermore, this results in improved teaching capabilities. For example, the most memorable professor from my university days was Mr. Yang, who was deeply involved in research and reading. He inspired us and taught us how to learn more effectively on our own. All my classmates rated him AAA, the mark of an excellent teacher.\nStudents can gain knowledge from textbooks, online resources, or instructors. However, we rely on professors for participation in research and personal development. Without engaging in research, professors can't offer such opportunities. Additionally, A professor immersed in research is constantly thinking and generating new ideas. They might inspire students to come up with innovative suggestions. This is beneficial for both professors and students.\nUltimately, Professors are a societal asset within the university. They are trailblazers in various fields, including science, arts, and culture.

I firmly believe that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be celebrated and it's rather unjust to impose limitations on artists' creative will.\nA primary concern regarding the unrestricted artistic creation stems from the fear of social misguidance that could destabilize society; however, I am convinced that audiences possess their own judgment and are unlikely to be misled or influenced by certain artworks. It goes without saying that art inherently involves imagination, exaggeration, and at times is purely fictional; whether or not the art is based on truth, it is up to the public to decide how to interpret its significance. If the art portrays unreality, the public certainly has the insight to recognize its falsehood and can appreciate its artistic value alone; if the art reflects reality, then what would be the reason to ban it unless it's to hide uncomfortable truths? Would it not be authoritarian if the government suppressed artists who are speaking the truth? In summary, the fear of societal misguidance is unfounded.\nLet's then examine the influence that art has on individuals. It is undeniable that some artworks may convey negative themes such as madness, violence, eroticism, etc..

{"id": "id_133", "input": "Public utilities and the surrounding environment are key considerations when deciding on a place to live. Yet, finding a community that fully aligns with our expectations can be quite challenging. In my hometown, most public services are well-established and cater to people's needs, except for transportation. Therefore, one of the changes I strongly desire is the addition of more public transportation options. This is especially significant since I encounter severe traffic congestion every single day, and the issue seems to be worsening over time.\nTo begin with, there should be more options like subway or sky train systems available, which would provide individuals would have greater flexibility in choosing their mode of travel. Currently, the only form of public transportation currently available is buses, meaning this leaves residents with no alternative choices. they are compelled to rely solely on buses to reach their destinations, limiting their options. However, having subway or sky train options would significantly improve convenience for everyone. For instance, taking a subway allows people to plan their trips based on a fixed schedule, whereas in contrast, buses do not offer the same scheduling reliability. Moreover, such advancements would indirectly alleviate road traffic problems.\nAdditionally, the buses in this community operate on only two routes, which this poses a significant issue for residents. For example, if my destination is not covered by the bus routes, I am forced to take a bus to the central station first and then transfer to another bus, leading to this process wastes a considerable amount of time. Consequently, introducing additional bus routes would make commuting far easier for residents.\nFinally, expanding public transportation options could reduce the reliance on private cars, which can bring about various benefits. For example, individuals would save money on fuel costs, which have been steadily increasing. Furthermore, the consumption of vital energy resources would gradually diminish, as fewer people would use their personal vehicles.\nIn conclusion, transportation is a fundamental aspect that directly impacts people's quality of life.

{"id": "id_136", "input": "Nowadays, closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras are extensively utilized across various settings. They are employed in educational institutions, businesses, and other locations to keep an eye on ongoing activities. It is undeniable that CCTV offers numerous advantages, particularly in curbing crime and safeguarding employees within a premise. However, some contend that these cameras intrude on their privacy due to constant surveillance. Despite this, I firmly assert that CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace.\nTo begin with, by having CCTV cameras at workplace, crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down. This is because when a shop is attacked by thieves, the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced. For instance, in Malaysia, policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight. Furthermore, as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance, they will less likely steal from the shops. Consequently, it is evident that CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized.\nAdditionally, at some offices, employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers. Occasionally, face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger. Therefore, the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation because the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded. In case of a dispute, the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken. In summary, these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers.\nFrom a different viewpoint, the deployment of CCTV cameras does spark debate. Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras. Nonetheless, one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences. Hence, opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime.\nIn conclusion, CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise. This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers. It is acknowledged that privacies are lost with the use of these cameras.

Personally, I believe that picking a career path aligned with one's parents' professions can positively impact one's professional journey. \nFirstly, given that parents are engaged in the same field, they can offer substantial assistance to their children, including specialized knowledge and industry-specific insights. For instance, my father is a software programmer, and he has taught me a great deal about coding and computer science. Whenever I encounter a challenge, I consult him for guidance. Since he possesses a wealth of experience, I can save a significant amount of time in problem-solving. This genuinely enhances my competitiveness compared to my peers. Had I chosen a different field from my father, I would have encountered greater challenges.\nHowever, given that parents have spent decades in their careers, they have built a substantial network within a particular industry. They possess deep understanding and can offer notable support to their children. For example, they are aware of which companies provide better benefits or educational opportunities. Additionally, friends within the same industry might even assist in writing recommendation letters for certain organizations. It is undeniable that a strong recommendation letter holds significant importance in today's competitive world. While others are still crafting their resumes, someone with an impressive recommendation letter has already cleared the initial interview stage. \nSome might contend that with changing times, the state of the job market has drastically changed. Thus, selecting a career similar to one's parents' might not always be the right choice. While I partially agree with this perspective, when it comes to trends, no one can forecast them accurately. The job market evolves at a rapid pace, making it so that predicting any profession's popularity over several decades is impossible.\nIn the discussion of whether one should choose a career akin to their parents', I have highlighted several factors that individuals can receive more guidance from their parents if they share the same industry.

I, on the other hand, partially agree with this notion and hold the view that artists should be granted freedom to create truly exceptional works of art.\nPrimarily, imposing restrictions on artists' ideas would inevitably stifle their creativity over time. It's clear that when allowed to express themselves, most artists will think innovatively and produce remarkable works like paintings or films. For instance, the paintings by Da Vinci and Michelangelo continue to be revered today as they were free from constraints during their time. In essence, without any constraints, artists will produce more inspiring and remarkable work.\nMoreover, it is a fundamental human right to express opinions in any manner, provided they do not harm the nation. today, numerous countries strive to showcase themselves as democratic. art serves as a medium to critique social issues and governmental policies within a nation. To further clarify this point, the renowned film '3 Idiots,' starring Aamir Khan, critiques the education system's focus on rote memorization rather than practical application. Therefore, restricting artists' freedom to express their feelings is a violation of human rights.\nFrom a different angle, there are certain negative consequences if artists are left unchecked. artists might delve into topics that could spark controversies in a country. For example, Malaysia is a multicultural nation where citizens coexist peacefully. if sensitive racial issues are raised in films or books, it could lead to societal unrest. Nonetheless, I am of the opinion that artists are aware of their limits and would not risk damaging their reputations with irresponsible actions.\nIn conclusion, it has become apparent that there should be no limitations on the work of artists. enabling them to think freely allows them to express themselves as ideas flow more naturally when unencumbered by restrictions. Consequently, despite the potential negative impacts of unrestricted expression, I am confident that many beautiful and remarkable pieces of art have emerged from the freedom to express ideas and thus, I firmly believe there should be no restrictions imposed on them.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay081", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 262, "to": 336}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 349, "to": 439}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 457, "to": 582}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 598, "to": 722}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 736, "to": 816}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 828, "to": 931}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 933, "to": 1002}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1004, "to": 1094}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1127, "to": 1271}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1284, "to": 1369}], "label": "Claim", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1466, "to": 1541}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1556, "to": 1624}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1626, "to": 1715}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1755, "to": 1861}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1906, "to": 1959}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1961, "to": 2024}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2028, "to": 2087}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2103, "to": 2168}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2190, "to": 2280}], "label": "Claim", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2308, "to": 2355}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 19}], "edges": [{"source": 4, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 17, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 4, 9, 12, 14, 18, 19]}
{"id": "id_145", "input": "There's been a lot of discussion on the significance of having good roommates and the impact they have on our school life. Studies indicate that friendships formed during university are likely to last a lifetime, and this is particularly true for those we share living spaces with. Personally, I believe the most crucial attribute of roommates is their thoughtfulness. Meanwhile, open communication is another vital trait of a good roommate. \nBeing considerate is key to any relationship. For instance, a roommate lowers the volume of music or TV at night. Sometimes we remain unaware of our actions until faced with similar situations ourselves. Always considering the other person's feelings before acting selfishly can greatly enhance the roommate relationship. Consequently, having a considerate roommate is extremely important for our academic life. This approach not only avoids disputes but also fosters friendships or even familial bonds.\nAdditionally, effective communication is essential in forming a good roommate relationship. People have varying daily habits, like making the bed in the morning. While some may find this task simple, others might see it as a daunting chore. Requesting a change of living arrangements over an unmade bed might be considered an overreaction. Thus, communication holds great importance as it helps to resolve misunderstandings. Through communication, bonds are strengthened, leading to a better mutual understanding.\nTo sum up, there are numerous worthwhile aspects of having a roommate that hold significance. I believe consideration and communication are the most essential qualities. However, it's not always possible to get exactly what we want.

In my view, professors should prioritize research activities over teaching students for several reasons outlined below.\nA professor embodies the role of a researcher or a specialist in a specific academic discipline. They should consistently nurture enthusiasm for their field to ensure that they can continually advance in their pursuits. Subsequently, they can excel in teaching tasks. For example, During my university studies, the most remarkable professor was Mr. Yang, who was deeply engaged in research and reading. He was also the one who inspired us and taught us how to study more effectively on our own. All my classmates rated him as AAA, an excellent teacher.\nStudents can acquire knowledge from textbooks, online resources, or instructors. However, but we can only rely on professors when seeking involvement in research and self-improvement. A professor who isn't engaged in research cannot provide us with such opportunities. Moreover, a professor immersed in research is constantly generating new ideas. They might inspire us as students to propose innovative suggestions. This benefits both professors and students.\nFinally, Professors in universities are assets to society. They are leaders in nearly every domain, including science, arts, and culture. Without their research, new technologies would not emerge rapidly. Without their research, more artworks would be lost without cause.

It goes without saying that art inherently involves imagination, exaggeration, and at times, pure fabrication; regardless of whether a piece of art is rooted in truth, it is up to the public to decide how to interpret its significance. If art portrays unreality, the public undoubtedly has the perceptiveness to recognize its inaccuracy and simply appreciate its artistic value; if art mirrors reality, then what purpose does banning it serve if not to obscure uncomfortable truths? Would it not be autocratic for the government to suppress artists who speak the truth? In summary, the fear of social misguidance is unwarranted.\nLet's then consider the impact art has on individuals.

Unfortunately, it's rare to find a community that perfectly fulfills all our needs. In my hometown, while most public services are well-provided, transportation remains a challenge. This is why the aspect I am most eager to change is the expansion of public transportation options. Given that I encounter traffic jams daily. And this issue seems to be worsening. \nInitially, there should be more public transportation choices, like subways or sky trains. Consequently, this would provide people with more travel options. As currently, buses are the sole form of public transport available here, This leaves residents without alternatives. They are forced to rely solely on buses for travel. The introduction of subways and sky trains would enhance convenience. For instance, train schedules allow people to better predict travel times. Conversely, buses do not offer such predictability. Furthermore, this enhancement could indirectly alleviate road traffic congestion. \nSecondly, the current bus system only covers two routes. This is undeniably a significant issue. For example, if my destination isn't on a bus route, I must first travel to a central station to switch buses. Clearly, this is a waste of time. Expanding bus routes would facilitate easier travel for residents.\nLastly, increasing public transport options can reduce personal car use. It also offers numerous benefits. For example, individuals can save money as fuel prices continue to rise. Essential energy resources will be conserved, because fewer personal vehicles are used.\nIn conclusion, transportation is a fundamental factor that profoundly impacts people's lives.

Consequently, This can affect their mental and physical well-being.\nAnother point is that Jobs can distract students from their academic pursuits. If students begin earning at a young age, they may become enticed by money. They might feel independent and choose to work more for financial gain. This can impact their education, causing a loss of interest in studies. Furthermore, They might abandon their studies to earn more.\nMoreover, A significant downside to teenagers working is missing out on the joys of childhood.

{"id": "id_151", "input": "Nowadays, closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras have become prevalent in various settings. They are employed in educational institutions, businesses, and numerous other venues to observe ongoing activities. It is indisputable that CCTV usage offers a multitude of advantages, notably in curbing criminal activities and safeguarding employees within a facility. However, there are those who contend that these cameras infringe upon their privacy due to constant surveillance. Despite this, I am firmly convinced that CCTV cameras ought to be installed in every establishment to tackle the rising theft rates and ensure employee safety.\nTo begin with, installing CCTV cameras at workplaces can lead to a reduction in crimes like burglary. This is attributed to the fact that in the event of a shop being targeted by thieves, footage from these cameras provides crucial evidence for tracking down the culprits. To provide a clearer example, in Malaysia, law enforcement utilized CCTV footage to locate and apprehend a group of thieves who raided a Seven Eleven store in the dead of night. Furthermore, employees, aware of being under constant observation, are less inclined to steal from their workplaces. Hence, it is evident that CCTV systems should be installed in all workplaces to effectively reduce crime rates.\nAdditionally, in certain offices, employees frequently deal with irate or upset patrons. Occasionally, direct interactions with a disgruntled customer can pose a physical threat to employees. Consequently, CCTV camera installations can assist employees in avoiding such perilous situations because customers are well-aware that their exchanges are being documented. When disputes arise, the footage can be examined to ascertain the incident's details and allow for appropriate measures. In summary, these surveillance systems offer a degree of protection for employees against customer aggression.\nFrom an alternative viewpoint, the deployment of CCTV cameras does spark debate. Critics of CCTV systems argue that constant camera surveillance violates their privacy. Nonetheless, it is crucial to recognize that safety holds greater significance than privacy, and taking preventative measures is preferable to facing adverse outcomes. Therefore, those opposed to such systems should strive to understand the situation and take proactive steps to avoid falling prey to criminal acts.\nIn conclusion, CCTV cameras are vital and should be installed in every establishment. Primarily, this is to protect oneself from potential harm by intruders or thieves. It is true that privacy is compromised with the implementation of these cameras.

In my opinion, while the protection of endangered animals holds significance, the needs of humans should take precedence.\nTo begin with, the global population is on a continual rise, so there is a growing demand for food among humans. Agricultural land is essential for cultivating crops like wheat and corn, and it's undeniable that without food, human survival is limited to just a few weeks. Consequently, farmlands are indispensable for sustaining human existence.\nAdditionally, individuals require shelters to shield themselves from natural elements like wind, floods, and wild animals, so land is necessary for constructing their homes. Housing is undeniably one of the fundamental human needs, right after food.\nMoreover, humans require essential items to sustain their lives, many of which are industrial, such as pharmaceuticals. Hence, certain areas must be allocated for industrial purposes. Modern life presents challenges that are alleviated with industrial advancements. \nIn summary, the number of endangered animals is significantly smaller compared to the human population, so they do not require as much land as humans do.

Personally, I believe that pursuing a career similar to one's parents can be advantageous for one's professional journey. \nTo begin with, since parents operate within the same field, they can offer significant support to their children, including specialized knowledge and industry insights. For instance, my father is a software developer, and he has imparted extensive programming and computer knowledge to me. I frequently consult him whenever I encounter challenges. Given that his vast experience, I can save a considerable amount of time searching for solutions. This undoubtedly gives me a competitive edge over my peers. Had I chosen a different field from my father, I would have encountered greater difficulties than I do now.\nHowever, considering that parents have decades of experience, they have built an extensive network within a specific industry. Their profound understanding allows them to offer substantial support to their children. For example, they are aware of which companies offer better benefits or educational opportunities. Additionally, their industry contacts can even help with recommendation letters for certain companies. It's indisputable that a strong recommendation letter is crucial in today's competitive job market.

Consequently, opting for a career similar to one's parents' isn't always the right choice. I partially agree with this viewpoint, but it's impossible to accurately predict future trends.

Based on my own experience, I frequently skipped biology classes because my university did not mandate attendance. Furthermore, I had preemptively studied all biology topics before university. Consequently, I used my biology class time for chemistry research and achieved an A+ in both subjects. \nIn conclusion, I believe students should be aware of which activities to prioritize and manage their learning time effectively.

This could potentially broaden your experiences, help you understand your personality, and uncover hidden talents. However, this approach may not always lead to success.

Therefore, I firmly assert that one should concentrate on their strengths.\nConcentrating on your strengths aids in achieving your objectives. There's no doubt that the more you dedicate time to your strengths, the greater your chances of achieving remarkable success. For example, Albert Einstein, renowned as one of the most brilliant physicists in history, committed most of his life to advancing physics theories, ultimately developing the theories of special and general relativity. Conversely, he paid little attention to other matters. Amazingly, it's believed he couldn't differentiate between hand soap and facial soap because, at least for him, using two distinct soaps was an irritation for him. As illustrated by the example above, focusing on your strengths increases the likelihood of fulfilling your goals.\nContinuing to excel at what you already do well enables you to improve further. Success in an activity brings greater satisfaction and interest. Subsequently, this self-motivation propels you to achieve even more. To illustrate, During junior high, I excelled in mathematics. Due to I found immense satisfaction in my ability to perform well, I became engrossed in tackling more advanced mathematical problems.

Furthermore, the application of technological science in medicine preparation also plays a crucial role in saving patients' lives.\nNevertheless, certain negative aspects of technological advancement need to be clearly highlighted.

{"id": "id_159", "input": "In many nations, artists enjoy the liberty to convey their thoughts through their creations. However, there is a debate on whether the government should impose restrictions to curb their opinions. Personally, I am only partially in agreement and believe that artists should be granted freedom to unleash their creativity, leading to the creation of magnificent masterpieces.\nPrimarily, if artists' ideas are controlled, their creative ability would inevitably diminish over time. It is indisputable that when allowed to express freely, many artists tend to think outside the box and produce remarkable artworks like paintings or films. For instance, the works of Da Vinci and Michelangelo are still revered because they weren't constrained in their era. In essence, without restrictions, artists are more likely to create awe-inspiring works.\nAdditionally, it is a fundamental human right to express one's opinions freely, provided they do not disrupt national harmony. Nowadays, many countries strive to demonstrate their democratic values. Arts serve as a medium to critique societal issues and government policies within a country. To further elaborate, the renowned film '3 Idiots' starring Aamir Khan critiques the education system focused on rote learning rather than practical application. Therefore, if artists are prohibited from freely expressing their emotions, it constitutes a violation of human rights.\nConsidering another viewpoint, there are certain negative consequences if artists are left unchecked. They might delve into sensitive topics that could spark controversy within a country. For example, Malaysia is a diverse nation where citizens coexist peacefully and harmoniously. If someone addresses sensitive racial issues in their films or books, it could lead to societal unrest. Nonetheless, I maintain that artists are generally aware of their limits and would not want to damage their reputation through reckless actions.\nIn summary, it is clear now that artists' work should not be subjected to any form of restriction. Giving them the freedom to think independently allows them to articulate their thoughts as ideas can naturally emerge when there are no constraints. Consequently, although unrestricted expression of ideas can have some adverse consequences, I firmly hold the view that many exceptional and beautiful artworks exist because of the freedom to express ideas and thus, I am convinced there should be no limitations placed on them.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "essay081", "framework": "synthetic", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 259, "to": 373}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 386, "to": 478}], "label": "Premise", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 504, "to": 634}], "label": "Premise", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 650, "to": 752}], "label": "Premise", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 766, "to": 841}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 857, "to": 968}], "label": "Premise", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 970, "to": 1040}], "label": "Premise", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1042, "to": 1133}], "label": "Premise", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1157, "to": 1295}], "label": "Premise", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1308, "to": 1415}], "label": "Claim", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1519, "to": 1603}], "label": "Premise", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1618, "to": 1697}], "label": "Premise", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1699, "to": 1801}], "label": "Claim", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1832, "to": 1946}], "label": "Premise", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1981, "to": 2045}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2047, "to": 2134}], "label": "Premise", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2138, "to": 2194}], "label": "Premise", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2210, "to": 2286}], "label": "Premise", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2316, "to": 2401}], "label": "Claim", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2427, "to": 2472}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 19}], "edges": [{"source": 4, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 17, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 4, 9, 12, 14, 18, 19]}

Studies indicate that friendships formed in university, particularly with roommates, are likely to last a lifetime. From my perspective, the most vital trait in roommates is being considerate. At the same time, another crucial characteristic of a good roommate is effective communication. \nBeing considerate is consistently crucial in any relationship. For instance, a considerate roommate lowers the volume of music or television at night. Sometimes, we're unaware of our actions until we experience them ourselves. Always considering others' feelings before acting selfishly can greatly strengthen roommate relationships. Consequently, having a considerate roommate is extremely important for our school life. This not only helps avoid conflicts but also fosters a friendship or familial bond.\nFurthermore, communication also plays a key role in making a good roommate. Individuals have different daily habits, like making the bed every morning. Some may find this task simple, while others might see it as a significant chore. If someone decides to move out just because their roommate doesn't make the bed in the morning, it might be an overreaction. Hence, communication holds great importance because as it helps to resolve misunderstandings. Through communication, bonds are formed, leading to a better understanding of each other.\nTo sum up, there are numerous valuable aspects of having a roommate that holds significance.

In my hometown, nearly all public utilities are available to meet one's needs, except when it comes to transportation. Therefore, what I truly wish to change is the introduction of more public transportation options. Given that I encounter traffic jams on a daily basis. And this issue seems to be worsening. \nInitially, there should be more options for public transportation, like subway or sky train services. Consequently, people would have multiple means to reach their destinations. Since currently, buses are the sole form of public transportation available in this area, it leaves the residents with no alternatives. They are compelled to rely solely on buses for traveling. Introducing subway and sky train services would greatly enhance convenience for them. For instance, people can plan their time efficiently using subway schedules. Conversely, such planning is impossible with buses. Additionally, this enhancement would indirectly reduce traffic congestion. \nSecondly, the buses only cover two routes in this locality. This poses a significant issue. For instance, if my intended destination isn't on the bus route, I must first go to the central station to switch buses, which doesn't lead directly to my destination. Clearly, this results in a considerable waste of time. more routes should be added to facilitate easier transportation for residents.\nFinally, expanding public transportation options can reduce the number of people using personal vehicles. It also offers numerous benefits. For example, individuals can save on fuel costs, which are climbing steadily. Energy resources will be conserved over time, as as fewer people rely on their personal cars.\nIn conclusion, transportation is a fundamental aspect that directly influences people's quality of life. I hope that one day this issue will be resolved.

{"id": "id_164", "input": "In recent times, the idea of taking a gap year prior to commencing university education has gained popularity. This trend is not limited to affluent students; it is increasingly observed among those from less privileged backgrounds as well. During this period, students often embark on global travels or decide to gain work experience.\nThe knowledge and insights acquired from exploring various destinations, interacting with diverse individuals, and engaging in employment can be immensely beneficial.. Such experiences not only boost a student's self-assurance but also foster a sense of autonomy.. Those who work are often able to accumulate financial resources that they can depend on during their university journey.. This period of experience also helps them gain clarity about their life's direction.. They cultivate a wider perspective, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding their future academic pursuits..\nDespite its advantages, taking a break can also present certain drawbacks.. Once students start earning, they might resist returning to academia, where they would sacrifice their financial freedom.. They may even struggle to readjust to the educational setting.. There's also the possibility that some students may never resume their university or higher educational path.. Some may opt for brief courses rather than a comprehensive university education, which could lead to better employment prospects and salaries.. However, this may only serve them well in the short term, as it's widely acknowledged that a solid and advanced qualification is essential for long-term career success..\nFrom my perspective, I support the notion of taking a hiatus before embarking on higher education.. Students who take such breaks reap numerous rewards through travel or work..

{"id": "id_165", "input": "From my perspective, it's not advisable for teenagers to have jobs while still attending school. While many people contend that it provides valuable work experience, I believe it can disrupt various aspects of their lives. Having jobs could negatively impact students' health. It distracts them from their education and robs them of their childhood.\nIn today's competitive environment, students need to devote a lot of time to their studies to excel. They must dedicate most of their time to school to achieve good grades. Taking on jobs during their remaining time adds extra pressure. Additionally, Jobs come with responsibilities like attendance and sometimes additional tasks. This can lead to stress, anxiety, and fatigue. They won't have enough time to relax and sleep properly. Consequently, this could affect their mental and physical well-being.\nMoreover, Jobs can cause students to lose focus on their studies. If students start earning money at an early age, they might become attracted to it. They may feel independent and choose to work more for financial gain. This can lead to a decline in their interest in academics. Furthermore, they might even drop out to earn more money.\nBesides, A major disadvantage of teenage employment is missing the joys of childhood. They miss out on activities like hanging out with friends, club participation, and social interaction. There is ample time in life to work, but the childhood phase is irreplaceable. Hence, they should cherish and make the most of their childhood.\nTherefore, it's crucial for teenagers to focus on their education.

{"id": "id_3", "input": "Deciding on a career path requires careful consideration. When it comes to choosing a profession similar to that of one's parents, opinions can vary widely among individuals. In my view, I believe pursuing a career similar to one's parents can be advantageous for one's professional growth. \nTo begin with, parents are familiar with the industry, they can offer substantial support to their children, including specialized knowledge and insights about the field. For instance, my father works as a software developer, and he has imparted significant programming skills and computer knowledge to me. Whenever I encounter a challenge, I seek his advice. Since he possesses a wealth of experience, I am able to save a considerable amount of time finding solutions. This gives me a competitive edge over my peers. If I were in a different sector from my father, I would encounter more difficulties than I do now.\nOn the other hand, given that parents have dedicated decades to their careers, they have built extensive networks within their industry. They possess deep insights and can offer substantial assistance to their children. For example, they are aware of which companies offer better benefits or educational opportunities. Additionally, their contacts in the industry can even provide recommendation letters for certain companies. Undoubtedly, a strong recommendation letter is crucial in today's competitive job market. While others might still be perfecting their resumes, someone with a solid recommendation letter has already advanced past the initial interview stage. \nSome might argue that with changing times, the job market conditions have changed dramatically. Thus, picking a career similar to one's parents' may not always be the right choice. I partially agree with this perspective, but when it comes to predicting trends, accuracy is elusive. The job market evolves at lightning speed, making it impossible to guarantee that it's impossible to foresee which careers will remain popular for three decades or more.\nIn weighing whether to pursue a career akin to one's parents', I have outlined several points that individuals can receive increased support from their parents if they share the same industry.
