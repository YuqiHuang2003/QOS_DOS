Our Court does not reject these letters, and we forward them to the attorney and organize a pre-trial conference with a judge or court attorney to facilitate a resolution between the parties. The Court must follow a timeline for these conferences, but we strive to be accommodating if a defendant has scheduling issues, we do our best to adjust accordingly. Upon filing summonses, half provide extensive details about the debt, while others merely state the amount owed.

{"id": "id_48", "input": "A recurring theme in discussions is that selling debt creates confusion about who the actual creditor is, and leads to a new credit entry, making the debt seem additional when it is merely transferred and appears as new. The remedy for this issue is straightforward; credit bureaus should be prohibited from listing more than one entry for the same debt. Responsibility for maintaining accurate records should be placed on the bureaus, because they are the sole organizations tasked with ensuring record accuracy and they receive payment to manage accurate records. At present, the expenses of faulty systems are shifted onto both creditors and borrowers, who then pass these costs onto others in the form of increased expenses. It doesn't matter whether these duplicate entries result from carelessness, lack of skill, or intentional actions by creditors or collectors because credit reporting agencies must ensure such practices are prevented.

The issue of Debt Defaults and Collections is predominantly one-sided, with judges being limited to confirming whether a default has taken place. Lawyers often represent those who deliberately choose to default since strategic defaulters usually have some financial resources or income to cover legal fees and part of the debt. Those who default involuntarily have to navigate the situation on their own as they lack the funds to hire legal assistance. Debt Neutrality, where an involuntary defaulter acknowledges their debt and aims to repay it based on the original amount at the time of default without additional penalties, interest, or fees, even over a decade, could reduce many unnecessary legal battles. Moreover, once the small initial payments are arranged, the account would not negatively impact the debtor's credit score or rating. To prevent fraud, debtors would be prohibited from taking on more debt until their defaults are fully settled. I believe this is a very rational approach.

{"id": "id_70", "input": "Collectors play a crucial role in reconnecting with clients who have fallen behind on their payments, offering services to aid in loan repayment irrespective of the technological tools employed. In the field of collections, systems for automated dialing significantly enhance the collector's ability to contact clients who are behind on payments and are reluctant to initiate contact with creditors. Automated dialing systems are utilized in various sectors beyond debt recovery: telemarketing employs them to contact potential clients, and educational institutions use them to inform parents about school closures due to severe weather conditions. While the technology remains unchanged, the user's intent varies. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) restricts creditors from making automated calls to mobile phones without obtaining the customer's approval. Initially, the TCPA aimed to shield consumers from incurring high charges due to automated calls, but its focus has shifted to curtailing excessive call attempts to numbers that are predominantly linked to customers. This does not alter the objective of collection calls, it simply renders the process less effective. Enforcing restrictions on which numbers can receive automated calls contradicts the increasing prevalence of households that rely solely on wireless communications. The Center for Disease Control's 'Wireless Substitution' report (Early release data, July-December 2012) indicates that more than one-third (36%) of adults in the United States reside in homes with only wireless phone service, and this percentage rises to 45% for children living in the U.S. Considering an annual growth rate averaging 34%, it is plausible that before 2020, only a small portion of adults in the nation will live in homes with landline phones suitable for autodialing.

Email platforms come with privacy and security configurations that prevent senders from knowing if or when an email has been accessed.

Experts in spam consistently advise against opening emails that are categorized as spam or suspected spam. This is due to the adeptness of spammers in circumventing privacy/security settings, compelling the recipient's email client to notify the sender upon email access. Moreover, I am uncomfortable with the notion that collectors are able to embed links within emails. Unprincipled collectors and employees may insert links that jeopardize computer security and are distasteful to recipients, such as explicit content. Consider the persistence of collectors in using offensive and abusive language over the phone, even after numerous lawsuits. Imagine the potential damage these nefarious individuals could inflict through emails. I also have an aversion to emails due to the simplicity with which collection agencies can trade email lists to marketing firms. Several decades ago, my neighbor was involved in debt collection. She would confide that if extracting money from debtors failed, they profited by selling addresses and personal details to marketing companies. I possess serious reservations about permitting collectors to utilize emails. Any regulations permitting collectors to use email should be accompanied by meticulous attention to privacy/security protocols, content scrutiny, and restrictions on selling email lists.

During this time, insurers were disbursing tens of millions of dollars to owners of buildings damaged by the 9/11 attacks even though technically, they were not obliged to do so as such incidents are deemed acts of war, which most insurance policies do not cover, the office of the comptroller of the currency was prohibiting insurance firms from entering competition with credit card companies in providing debt suspension insurance. Consequently, credit card companies monopolized the debt suspension insurance market, inflating premiums by 1000% to 2000% The profit was so excessive from this insurance that the CFPB had to impose fines exceeding $500 million on credit card firms in 2012 due to aggressive sales and marketing tactics. Back in 2008, I raised alarms about the inflated costs of credit card debt suspension insurance through the creation of __URL__ yet, my efforts went uncompensated. This led to a situation where most credit card defaults in the U.S. over the past decade or so stemmed from the deceptive foundation of exorbitantly priced debt suspension insurance that consumers could not continue to purchase. Consumers ended up paying for five years' worth of insurance but only received coverage for 3-5 months! Judges often upheld these overpriced monopolistic insurance policies during credit card default declarations, failing to offer consumers a clear method to shield themselves from defaults triggered by significant life changes. By taking the necessary actions, we could rapidly rejuvenate the U.S. economy. We must first recognize the fraud committed by credit card companies with debt suspension insurance over the last 10 to 15 years and, as compensation, reduce consumer credit card debt by roughly 65%. Subsequently, increase the monthly minimum payment on the remainder from 2% to 5% so that the monthly payment remains nearly unchanged, yet consumers perceive their debt diminishing more effectively. Around 2005, the comptroller attempted to urge credit card companies to boost their monthly minimum payment requirements from 2% to 4 or 5% but backed down due to the risk of widespread defaults. By slashing consumer credit card debt by 65% as restitution for insurance fraud, consumers would suddenly face less debt while maintaining similar monthly payments.

Nevertheless, the harm is already inflicted and recovery may take several years. __URL__", "topic": null, "demo_id": "00549", "framework": "cdcp", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 0, "to": 70}], "label": "fact", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 71, "to": 159}], "label": "fact", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 160, "to": 230}], "label": "fact", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 231, "to": 337}], "label": "fact", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 338, "to": 482}], "label": "fact", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 483, "to": 563}], "label": "value", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 564, "to": 571}], "label": "reference", "id": 6}], "edges": [{"source": 0, "target": 6, "label": "CDCP_evidence"}, {"source": 1, "target": 6, "label": "CDCP_evidence"}, {"source": 2, "target": 0, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 2, "target": 1, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 2, "target": 6, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 3, "target": 6, "label": "CDCP_evidence"}, {"source": 4, "target": 6, "label": "CDCP_evidence"}], "tops": [2, 3, 4, 5]}

Nonetheless, overseeing litigation is crucial to ensure the system doesn't permit gain without risk. A plaintiff in a lawsuit must not find it advantageous to sue with little justification and minimal risk. Creditors and those engaged in recovery proceedings should not be burdened with more regulations in this domain as their activities are already under CFPB's scrutiny. The CFPB need not impose industry standards, but should specify that only documents submitted during the initial court filing will be evaluated in a CFPB review. In instances where a CFPB review reveals that a lawsuit was filed without proper fact verification, the CFPB might compensate the defendant with the claimed amount and impose a fine ranging from $2,000 to the full amount sought. This stance would incentivize litigants to verify their facts before proceeding with a filing. This stance permits the CFPB to scrutinize cases irrespective of their court outcomes. Such reviews could be carried out at CFPB headquarters as they only require the original submission documents. The review process could be triggered by a complaint filed with the agency. The fines could be adjusted according to various agency-defined criteria.

If the consumer is indeed facing financial difficulties, one would expect them to either respond to the call or reach out to the debt collection agency to try to resolve the issue. Regarding regulations, I believe that a single call per week is adequate. The purpose of a robo-call is to keep the debt in the consumer's awareness so that when they have the funds, they will remember to make the payment. Any other purpose, in my opinion, would be an attempt to irritate the consumer into making a payment. The group that tolerates this tactic is unlikely to pay anyway, so why continue the charade?

{"id": "id_155", "input": "The primary issue, in my view, arises from financial institutions having two separate systems that are not completely integrated. One of these is the record-keeping system that holds detailed account information and the other is a charge-off system designed to monitor activities post-account charge-off. Typically, occurrences recorded in the charge-off system are not reflected in the record-keeping system. Furthermore, the charge-off system is either not utilized or not intended for credit reporting purposes. The second issue stems from mergers or acquisitions where the financial institution updates only the record-keeping system, leaving the acquired charge-off system unchanged. This results in a gap concerning the status of accounts after they have been charged off. When accounts are outsourced or sold the dependency on information rests solely on the record-keeping system and not on the charge-off system. Another issue arises when a consumer holds multiple accounts with the original lender, increasing the chance that one account might be transferred to a different agency or debt buyer. Even if the debt buyer and collector have access, the events that occurred are often absent from the record-keeping system, and the charge-off system could have been phased out. The matter of dispute credit reporting is contingent on whether an agency or debt buyer provides information to a credit reporting bureau. The volume of consumer data submitted to credit reporting bureaus, both currently and in the past, might not be precise regarding charged-off accounts, and demanding a chain of title would be costly, with accuracy still not guaranteed.

I think the best option for consumers is to allow lawsuits to be filed in the jurisdiction where they currently live, unless it deals with real estate, in which case it should be where the property is situated.

The statement should read, \"You were charged on (DATE) for services at (PLACE).\" If there are other payments associated with the same visit that have been settled, the letter should reflect this, for instance, \"You have already covered other services from this visit, but still owe...\" or \"Some of the visit's expenses were covered by your insurance, yet you still owe...\" This complication is tied to the convoluted nature of medical billing, but these complexities should never be used as a means to obscure the debt's origins from consumers.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "01119", "framework": "cdcp", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 0, "to": 355}], "label": "policy", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 356, "to": 623}], "label": "testimony", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 624, "to": 690}], "label": "value", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 691, "to": 787}], "label": "value", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 788, "to": 889}], "label": "policy", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 890, "to": 970}], "label": "policy", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 971, "to": 1262}], "label": "policy", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1263, "to": 1333}], "label": "value", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1334, "to": 1434}], "label": "policy", "id": 8}], "edges": [{"source": 0, "target": 1, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "CDCP_reason"}], "tops": [0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8]}

{"id": "id_186", "input": "This proposal is excellent. Currently, debt purchasers acquire debt at an average cost of 4 cents per dollar. Numerous debts are acquired at rates ranging from 2 to 4 cents on the dollar. Additionally, some debts are transferred without any cost. If I were a primary creditor, I would aim to maximize the returns from a debt owed to me. Thus, if I could receive 10 cents per dollar directly from the debtor, instead of 4 cents from a debt buyer, I would be inclined to offer the debtor a significantly reduced debt settlement rate (or, as it's termed, allowing consumers to bid on their own debt). At present, original creditors do not offer substantial reductions to debtors before selling the debt for 4 cents on the dollar. The majority of creditors seldom propose a settlement offer that includes a 10% discount on the debt. Certainly, a creditor might expedite the process of offloading portfolios to debt buyers by selling them at 4 cents per dollar. However, creditors could potentially earn significantly more by presenting a one-time offer of 10 cents on the dollar (or another appealing amount that exceeds 4 cents per dollar). The CFPB could consider implementing a regulation that offers consumers/debtors a one-time opportunity to accept a reduced rate offer, valid for a specified short period (perhaps 45 days) from the date of notification from their creditors. This offer would be limited to a brief timeframe and would inform the consumer that if they do not accept, the creditor will then sell the debt to a debt buyer. Such a letter would only be dispatched if the creditor intends to sell the debt, rather than making another collection attempt. This approach provides consumers with a final opportunity to settle their debts. Meanwhile, creditors would experience reduced losses and increased profits, enabling them to extend more loans, offer better rates to consumers, and invigorate the economy.

I believe the Gideon Decision by the Supreme Court exists, which ensures any accused person the right to an adequate defense, therefore, if any debt collector or creditor denies the alleged debtor the opportunity for a fair trial or defense, then CFPB attorneys must take strong action against such offenders. The foundational principle of any CFPB regulations should guarantee that no alleged debtor is coerced into settling debts or caught off guard by the court. There are occasions when unpaid bills have justified reasons and consumers should have the opportunity to address any grievances with the creditor before settling the bills. It's actually a very straightforward and uncomplicated matter. The CFPB simply needs to establish basic rules that safeguard consumers and clearly state that the responsibility of proof lies with the creditor before engaging any debt collector to recover such debts. Debt collectors should only be allowed to operate within specific guidelines and cases should be brought before a small claims court for both parties to present their arguments prior to a court decision, rather than allowing the claim to be reported to a credit reporting agency which would unjustly harm the consumer's credit score or rating without their knowledge, which is entirely wrong.

{"id": "id_258", "input": "I am currently enduring a distressing ordeal with a creditor and a debt collector. In 2004, I finished my college education and consolidated all my student loans with Nelnet. Around 2005, I began receiving calls from debt collectors who claimed I was behind on my loan payments. I clarified the situation, stating that all my payments through Nelnet were punctual, and insisted on seeing proof of the debt before making any further payments. However, I never received any evidence of the debt. This same conversation repeated over the next five years. In 2011, I aspired to purchase my wife's dream home. This was a major financial decision. The bankers I consulted informed me that resolving the student loan issue was necessary for approval. I reached out to the original creditor and debt collector, pleading for proof of the loan. They presented me with a loan application, which lacked any confirmation of approval or evidence of funds disbursement. Although I was uneasy about the so-called proof, I realized that a legal battle in court would take longer than I was willing to endure. Therefore, I was meticulous in my discussions with the creditor and debt collector, ensuring the issue would be resolved on my credit report if I paid the full amount of the alleged loan. I also recorded my conversations with both the creditor and the debt collector. I paid the original loan sum, but, as you might have anticipated, the original creditor refused to update my credit report. Even after submitting proof of payment, the credit reporting agencies also declined to revise my credit report. To add to my woes, after settling the debt, I was notified by the debt collector that several thousand dollars had been forgiven. I promptly contacted the debt collector, requesting documentation to justify their claimed amount, including records of any agreed interest rate. I received no reply. Presently, I am in dispute with the IRS over potential extra taxes owed. Even though I cleared the debt two years ago, my credit report remains unchanged. It's absurd that any business can wield such influence to severely affect someone's life without providing documentation to justify their actions. Creditors should be mandated to supply specific documentation before submitting negative credit reports, and there should be substantial penalties for pursuing debts without the requisite documentation.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "01267", "framework": "cdcp", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 0, "to": 82}], "label": "value", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 83, "to": 174}], "label": "testimony", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 175, "to": 278}], "label": "testimony", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 279, "to": 441}], "label": "testimony", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 442, "to": 493}], "label": "testimony", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 494, "to": 551}], "label": "testimony", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 552, "to": 604}], "label": "value", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 605, "to": 641}], "label": "value", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 642, "to": 743}], "label": "testimony", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 744, "to": 834}], "label": "testimony", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 835, "to": 954}], "label": "testimony", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 955, "to": 1003}], "label": "value", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1004, "to": 1091}], "label": "value", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1092, "to": 1279}], "label": "value", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1280, "to": 1359}], "label": "testimony", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1360, "to": 1389}], "label": "testimony", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1390, "to": 1483}], "label": "testimony", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1484, "to": 1595}], "label": "testimony", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1596, "to": 1725}], "label": "testimony", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1726, "to": 1892}], "label": "testimony", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1893, "to": 1965}], "label": "testimony", "id": 20}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1966, "to": 2047}], "label": "testimony", "id": 21}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2048, "to": 2194}], "label": "value", "id": 22}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2195, "to": 2397}], "label": "policy", "id": 23}], "edges": [{"source": 13, "target": 12, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 20, "target": 19, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 23, "target": 22, "label": "CDCP_reason"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23]}

The objective should be to develop a solution that equally advantages both debt collectors and consumers.

In truth, if a debt collector or owner cannot resolve issues within the existing state-specific SOL, extending it or introducing a national SOL merely allows them to continue harassing consumers. Three years is indeed ample time to initiate a lawsuit. Consumers, like criminal defendants, deserve a prompt resolution, even if they are unaware of outstanding debts.

This enabled credit card firms to establish a significant monopoly on exorbitantly priced credit card debt suspension insurance premiums imposed on their own clientele, who could have otherwise opted for insurance policies to freeze interest charges during critical emergencies. Financial literacy becomes relevant when considering the 2% monthly minimum payment scheme targeting novice credit card users. These 2% monthly minimum payments are akin to a drug dealer offering free samples of crack to hook individuals on their product. Someone can purchase a $1,000 high-end television and owe only a $20 or $25 payment the following month. In my view, that's akin to credit card addiction. Financial Literacy could entail including a prominent warning on every credit card agreement, highlighting how low monthly minimum payments are strategically used to entrap consumers in escalating debt, the lack of empathy from credit card companies during life-altering events, and the excessive overcharging for debt suspension insurance by as much as 2,000%. These three warnings should be prominently displayed in every agreement, and two outcomes emerge, customers are more likely to become financially savvy, and it simultaneously serves as an acknowledgment of deceit by credit card companies for all existing agreements. The irony is that credit card companies are unable to reform even if they wish to. Yet, where should the external pressure originate to ensure the implementation of these crucial warnings? It seems it cannot originate from the CFPB, which is regrettable as it further restricts the judiciary's ability to act.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "01041", "framework": "cdcp", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 0, "to": 46}], "label": "value", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 47, "to": 303}], "label": "value", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 304, "to": 484}], "label": "fact", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 485, "to": 763}], "label": "fact", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 764, "to": 890}], "label": "value", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 891, "to": 1019}], "label": "value", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1020, "to": 1124}], "label": "fact", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1125, "to": 1174}], "label": "value", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1175, "to": 1536}], "label": "policy", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1537, "to": 1609}], "label": "policy", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1610, "to": 1634}], "label": "value", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1635, "to": 1689}], "label": "value", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1690, "to": 1803}], "label": "value", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1804, "to": 1886}], "label": "value", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1887, "to": 1992}], "label": "value", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1993, "to": 2036}], "label": "fact", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2037, "to": 2057}], "label": "value", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2058, "to": 2113}], "label": "value", "id": 17}], "edges": [{"source": 9, "target": 11, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 9, "target": 12, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 16, "target": 17, "label": "CDCP_reason"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16]}

The robo-calls went unanswered; whenever I answered, no one was there, and they never left any voicemail. The caller ID appeared as \"1 Unavailable,\" designed to circumvent call-blocking from the receiving end, making it impossible to trace the caller using reverse lookups or similar methods. Eventually, I answered and finally connected with someone on the line, allowing me to discover who was making the calls, though they hesitated to reveal their identity. I proceeded to search for them online and found a contact number. I persistently clarified that I was not the debtor they sought, yet they continued to call. I ultimately consulted an attorney and after months of the attorney negotiating with them, I obtained a modest settlement. This took place while I was undergoing chemotherapy for cancer and was in poor health. My existence was a nightmare due to these practices for months. Debt collectors should be barred from hiding their identities or their callback numbers. This situation arose because I had relocated and received a new phone number that had previously been assigned to several individuals with pending debts. I felt uneasy about changing my number again as it might only lead to another wave of collectors. There should be significantly harsher monetary penalties for such violations. The culprit in this case was a national collection agency with substantial annual earnings; the small amount I eventually received was merely a minuscule fraction compared to their yearly profits. As an attorney myself, I checked their record through Pacer-- they had faced multiple lawsuits in state and federal courts and paid million-dollar fines to state attorneys general--just a minor expense in relation to their vast annual revenues.

Consequently, I seldom face medical bills, or if I do, they are minimal. After the surgery, though I can't remember the exact timing, I received persistent phone calls from someone saying, \"This is (first name), please call me at (phone number)\". We didn't recognize the caller, so nobody returned the calls. Our thought was to report it to the DONOTCALL registry, but we lacked a company name to report. Eventually, I answered the phone when that number appeared again, and a man asked, \"You know what this is regarding, right?\" I replied with \"no\". He explained, \"You have an outstanding balance with (hospital name). Your bill hasn't been paid. I am with a debt collection agency.\" I responded, \"I have never seen a bill.\" He reacted with \"really?\" I replied, \"yes\" He instructed, \"Contact the hospital's accounting department.\" Upon contacting the hospital, they advised me to reach out to my insurer. I spoke with my second insurance provider, and they confirmed that both insurers had settled the hospital's charges. The second insurer mentioned I was responsible for a minor amount, around $1.08. A debt collection firm had been engaged to recover $1.08, despite me never receiving a billing statement! I requested additional copies of the Explanation of Benefits from both insurance companies. Upon receiving them, I forwarded these documents to the hospital's billing office, along with a check for the sum my second insurer stated I owed. A bill was never sent to me. Nor was I informed it might be escalated to a collection agency. A collection agency was engaged to recover a sum marginally over $1.00.

{"id": "id_391", "input": "I propose a regulation that bans debt collectors, debt purchasers, and associated parties from accessing a debtor's credit report once the debt is officially time-barred and beyond the statute of limitations. Additionally, I advocate for a rule that clearly differentiates between \"hard pull\" and \"soft pull\" credit inquiries. For several years, I have opted out of promotional marketing through the __URL__ site. I am free of debt and have never incurred any. However, I do possess a name that is quite common, resulting in occasional \"soft pulls\" of my credit reports by various debt collectors and buyers who are searching for someone else. This practice should be prohibited even if the debt is still legally collectible and within the statute of limitations. Debt collectors lack a \"permissible purpose\" to randomly \"soft pull\" my credit reports just because I have a common name. Regarding debts that are outside the statute of limitations and time-barred: debt collectors and debt purchasers should not be permitted to access an individual's credit report as they are unable to legally pursue the debtor in court once the statute of limitations has expired. Therefore, there's no reason to continue checking someone's credit report. When it comes to \"hard pull\" versus \"soft pull\": there must be explicit regulations preventing debt collectors, debt purchasers, and similar entities from conducting \"hard pull\" credit inquiries. The FCRA outlines what constitutes \"permissible purposes\" but does not specifically clarify the differences between \"hard pull\" and \"soft pull\" credit inquiries. A \"hard pull\" occurs when a consumer requests a credit extension. Any request not initiated by the consumer is considered a \"soft pull.\" However, time and again, friends, relatives, and members of online communities inform me and provide evidence that a debt collector or purchaser has \"hard pulled\" their credit report. And some instances occur when the debt is time-barred, being outside the statute of limitations and the Credit Reporting Time Period. This situation is intolerable. A \"hard pull\" can lower a consumer's credit score and remain visible for up to 25 months to anyone with a legitimate reason to check that consumer's credit report. Performing a \"hard pull\" on a debtor's credit report may infringe upon the FDCPA, violating the privacy of the debtor. Debt collectors, debt purchasers, and related affiliates should be barred from conducting \"hard pulls\" and the CFPB needs to make this unequivocally clear. www.optoutprescreen.com __URL__", "topic": null, "demo_id": "01068", "framework": "cdcp", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 0, "to": 208}], "label": "policy", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 209, "to": 326}], "label": "policy", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 327, "to": 413}], "label": "testimony", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 414, "to": 460}], "label": "testimony", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 461, "to": 511}], "label": "value", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 512, "to": 643}], "label": "testimony", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 644, "to": 763}], "label": "policy", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 764, "to": 885}], "label": "fact", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 886, "to": 1062}], "label": "policy", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1063, "to": 1164}], "label": "fact", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1165, "to": 1239}], "label": "value", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1240, "to": 1435}], "label": "policy", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1436, "to": 1493}], "label": "value", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1494, "to": 1597}], "label": "fact", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1598, "to": 1663}], "label": "fact", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1664, "to": 1734}], "label": "fact", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1735, "to": 1918}], "label": "testimony", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1919, "to": 2052}], "label": "testimony", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2053, "to": 2083}], "label": "value", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2084, "to": 2247}], "label": "fact", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2248, "to": 2366}], "label": "fact", "id": 20}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2367, "to": 2469}], "label": "policy", "id": 21}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2470, "to": 2522}], "label": "policy", "id": 22}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2523, "to": 2554}], "label": "reference", "id": 23}], "edges": [{"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 8, "target": 10, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 10, "target": 9, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 11, "target": 12, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 21, "target": 19, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 21, "target": 20, "label": "CDCP_reason"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23]}

{"id": "id_400", "input": "Numerous disagreements are challenging to examine due to the ambiguity surrounding the consumer's actual issue. When the consumer provides enough specifics, enabling a clear matter for investigation, we proceed accordingly. Yet, if it's a generic complaint like \"I dispute this debt\" or \"I don't owe this debt\" (which happens very often), we resort to supplying statements or contracts to tackle the matter. The depth of our investigation is largely determined by the detail shared by the consumer, and most of the time, we depend on the creditor's documentation to settle the dispute. Occasionally, we might request the creditor to delve into their records for evidence of X, Y, or Z, though often the dispute lacks such specificity. In my experience, we frequently ask consumers to provide supporting information for their disputes (like proof of payment), but when they fail to do so, our investigation efforts reach a standstill. Mandating only a \"reasonable\" investigation, without clear definition, seems to defer to the courts for interpretation after prolonged litigation. I believe at least a general guideline for acquiring documentation to substantiate that the consumer owes the debt/amount/and creditor is a sensible starting point. It would be beneficial for consumers to utilize a form letter from the CFPB that outlines various disputes and assists them in better articulating their concerns. I do consider one of the most challenging obstacles for a collector (and a major grievance from individuals facing collection) is when someone claims the debt belongs to another person with the same name. We diligently conduct thorough investigations on our side (we try to match the last four digits of the social, we may perform a skip trace to verify if the individual we contacted resided at the address listed on the statements, etc. and we provide verification, yet, in a highly mobile world, confirming that the John Smith we've reached is indeed the same John Smith responsible for the debt can be complicated. This becomes particularly difficult when there's no clear indication that we've contacted the wrong individual.

{"id": "id_428", "input": "Debt collectors initiate a substantial number of default judgments primarily because consumers fail to respond, not due to ignorance of the matter. Typically, by the time a lawsuit commences, debt collectors have attempted resolution through calls and/or letters. This doesn't take into account the efforts made by the original creditor. Initiating a lawsuit is never the initial response. It generally occurs after multiple unsuccessful attempts to collaborate with a consumer to settle an unpaid debt. A default judgment simply extends this process further. Even after litigation begins, we may endeavor to contact the consumer to resolve the issue prior to a judgment being made. I've encountered many cases where we've communicated with the consumer, informing them they can respond, yet they still don't. In my view, default judgments predominantly stem from consumers' intentional disengagement rather than misleading actions by collectors. I must mention that several states have regulations stipulating that if there's no reaction to a summons and the consumer defaults, they aren't required to be notified of a motion for default judgment. Thus, the actual issuance of the judgment could indeed be unexpected, despite the summons indicating that a judgment might be issued if unresponded. Nevertheless, an attorney adhering to local regulations isn't behaving deceitfully. To mitigate the surprise for consumers who don't respond, it might be beneficial to mandate that all judgment motions be served to the consumer, despite existing local rules. I would highlight that numerous default judgment motions aren't scheduled for motion hour. They might be simply presented for decision without a court session. Regarding what is necessary to substantiate a default judgment, this varies between different courts and judges. The courts I've observed that require more documentation typically seek affidavits of debt, charge-off statements, and records of payments or charges, along with the assignment (if the plaintiff is a debt purchaser).", "topic": null, "demo_id": "00686", "framework": "cdcp", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 0, "to": 66}], "label": "fact", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 67, "to": 147}], "label": "value", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 148, "to": 263}], "label": "value", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 264, "to": 337}], "label": "value", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 338, "to": 389}], "label": "fact", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 390, "to": 503}], "label": "value", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 504, "to": 559}], "label": "value", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 560, "to": 682}], "label": "value", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 683, "to": 809}], "label": "testimony", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 810, "to": 946}], "label": "value", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 947, "to": 1148}], "label": "value", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1149, "to": 1297}], "label": "value", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1298, "to": 1381}], "label": "value", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1382, "to": 1556}], "label": "value", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1557, "to": 1647}], "label": "value", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1648, "to": 1716}], "label": "value", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1717, "to": 1829}], "label": "fact", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1830, "to": 2046}], "label": "testimony", "id": 17}], "edges": [{"source": 0, "target": 1, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 4, "target": 5, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 11, "target": 10, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 14, "target": 15, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 16, "target": 17, "label": "CDCP_evidence"}], "tops": [0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16]}

This discussion isn't about wiping out debts, it's about designating a debt as neutral, meaning no further penalties, fees, or interest rate increases would be imposed, and the debtor commits to repaying the debt sensibly, even if it takes a decade. __URL__", "topic": null, "demo_id": "00635", "framework": "cdcp", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 0, "to": 142}], "label": "value", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 143, "to": 292}], "label": "value", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 293, "to": 524}], "label": "policy", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 525, "to": 570}], "label": "value", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 571, "to": 774}], "label": "value", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 775, "to": 782}], "label": "reference", "id": 5}], "edges": [{"source": 0, "target": 1, "label": "CDCP_reason"}], "tops": [0, 2, 3, 4, 5]}

{"id": "id_473", "input": "Considering the severe repercussions of negative data being shared with or by CRAs on consumer credit reports, it is fair to assert that a debt should not be considered \"verified\" or \"substantiated\" until a final non-appealable judgment is issued, but only if the consumer has promptly contested the debt's existence or amount. At present, disputing a debt leads to the debt collector notifying the CRAs which results in an unfavorable effect on your credit score; essentially, the damage is done by that stage. To put it simply, the indication that a consumer disputes a debt on their credit report is mostly disregarded by potential lenders, employers, landlords, and others. Consequently, disputing the debt fails to shield the consumer from harm. Debt collectors and creditors use the threat of reporting to CRAs as a manipulative strategy to compel payment even though you may not actually owe the debt or the full amount claimed. Regarding my suggestion, I believe it won't result in increased litigation. In fact, it might do the opposite. If a consumer does not dispute the debt promptly, then it can be considered verified or substantiated. However, if the debt is disputed in a timely manner, creditors and collectors will need to decide whether to pursue legal action and evaluate their chances of success at trial, potentially leading them to be more selective about which debts to litigate. This proposal would further safeguard consumers from credit score damage until it is definitively established that a contested debt is actually owed and the precise amount is confirmed. Alternatively, a rule could be established imposing hefty statutory penalties, triple damages, and recovery of attorney's fees against creditors, collectors, and CRAs if the consumer can prove the disputed debt is nonexistent or less than claimed. This method, however, places the responsibility of proving the case on the consumer.

Regarding the second issue, I contend that a significant majority of consumer debts are repayable. Nevertheless, exceptions will inevitably occur. For debts deemed irrecoverable for any reason, they should be written off and barred from being resold for collection. Clarification and precise definitions of \"Not Collectable\" should be established by the relevant regulatory body. Addressing the third point, both parties need to be evaluated. Existing credit reporting agencies already track consumer-related aspects, and an additional score could be integrated into the consumer's credit history. This would serve as a foundation to enhance as refinements are made to the system. Conversely, the collector would necessitate a new evaluation system that assesses both the organization and the individuals involved in debt settlement processes. For effective models of such a system, one might look to the Department of Transportation's Compliance-Safety-Accountability framework. Admittedly, their methodology is more intricate and detailed than what the debt industry demands. Nonetheless, their scoring approach is adaptable and poised for future modifications. It would also enable the evaluation of the original creditor. Such evaluation would provide government and investors with a clearer understanding of a business's risk profile. Incorporating Mr. Bartmann's suggestions would foster a self-regulating environment among collectors and financial entities aimed at ethical outcomes rather than hiding behind legal technicalities. This approach benefits both parties and assists many consumers in escaping the vicious cycle of debt. Finally, the federal government could deploy this system with minimal interference with state sovereignty. This would decrease the instances of court cases at the state and local levels, encouraging states to participate.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "00595", "framework": "cdcp", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 0, "to": 79}], "label": "value", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 80, "to": 218}], "label": "policy", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 219, "to": 413}], "label": "policy", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 414, "to": 512}], "label": "fact", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 513, "to": 560}], "label": "fact", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 561, "to": 679}], "label": "policy", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 680, "to": 793}], "label": "policy", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 794, "to": 856}], "label": "policy", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 857, "to": 1011}], "label": "fact", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1012, "to": 1094}], "label": "value", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1095, "to": 1257}], "label": "value", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1258, "to": 1393}], "label": "value", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1394, "to": 1491}], "label": "value", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1492, "to": 1577}], "label": "value", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1578, "to": 1639}], "label": "value", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1640, "to": 1753}], "label": "value", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1754, "to": 1951}], "label": "value", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1952, "to": 2053}], "label": "value", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2054, "to": 2160}], "label": "value", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2161, "to": 2275}], "label": "value", "id": 19}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 1, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 9, "target": 8, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 18, "target": 19, "label": "CDCP_reason"}], "tops": [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]}

{"id": "id_593", "input": "Collectors have the obligation to reconnect with customers who have fallen behind and to offer services aiding them in loan repayment, irrespective of the technology in use. Within the Collections sector, systems that automate dialing significantly boost the collector's capacity to contact customers who are behind on payments and are reluctant to initiate contact with creditors. Automated dialing systems are employed in various contexts beyond debt collection: they are utilized by telemarketers to approach potential buyers, and by educational institutions to inform parents about closures due to adverse weather conditions. The underlying technology remains unchanged however, the intention varies depending on the user. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) restricts creditors from using automated dialing systems to contact cell phone numbers without obtaining the customer's consent. The TCPA's initial aim, which was to shield consumers from expensive charges due to automated calls, has been overtaken by the new objective of limiting excessive call attempts to a number typically linked directly to the customer. This does not alter the intent of collection calls, it simply renders the process less efficient. Regulating which numbers can be dialed using an automated system contradicts the increasing trend towards households that solely rely on wireless communication. Based on the Center for Disease Control's 'Wireless Substitution' recent report (Early release information, July-December 2012), over a third (36%) of adults in the United States reside in homes with only wireless phone service. This percentage is even greater (45%) for children living in the US. With a projected annual growth rate of 34%, it is plausible that before 2020, only a small fraction of the nation's adults will reside in homes with a landline that can be autodialed. The CFPB should permit the autodialing of all phone numbers supplied by the customer without intricate consent processes.

However, many genuinely have no idea, with a substantial 90% of these collections being related to medical expenses. To genuinely safeguard consumer interests, the CFPB should significantly streamline the debt collection procedures, especially for items like medical and utility debts. An account can be closed after 60 days of missed payments. The creditor should send a certified letter to the debtor's last known address, notifying them they have 30 days to settle the account or arrange alternative payment options, or else the account will be forwarded to a collection agency. This letter must also include the contact details for the collection agency, so the debtor is aware of whom to reach out to if they fail to act within the 30-day period. Although many of these letters may be returned as undeliverable or be received by the wrong recipients, it would still reflect a sincere attempt by creditors to engage with debtors before involving a collection agency.

{"id": "id_626", "input": "Email communication raises numerous concerns for me. Email platforms feature privacy and security settings that prevent senders from knowing if or when their messages have been delivered or read. However, despite these protective settings, senders can still find ways to bypass them. This tactic is commonly exploited by spammers and cybercriminals. Experts in spam prevention unanimously advise against opening emails that appear to be spam or potentially harmful. This is due to the fact that spammers are highly skilled at circumventing privacy and security measures, compelling email clients to notify them when emails are accessed. Moreover, I am uncomfortable with the notion that collectors can embed links within emails. Deceptive collectors and unethical employees might insert links that jeopardize computer security or contain offensive content, such as explicit material. Consider the persistence of collectors who, despite numerous legal challenges, continue to use offensive and abusive language over the phone, imagine the potential damage these individuals could inflict through email communication. I also harbor dislike towards emails because collection agencies can effortlessly sell email lists to marketers. Several decades ago, my neighbor worked as a debt collector. She confided that if they couldn't extract payment from debtors, they would profit by selling their addresses and personal details to marketing firms. I am deeply concerned about permitting collectors to utilize emails. Any regulations allowing collectors to use email should be crafted with meticulous attention to privacy/security, the nature of materials and content, and restrictions on selling email lists.

{"id": "id_630", "input": "Arguably, the most outrageous incident concerning credit card debt took place in 2002, coincidentally near the aftermath of 911. At that time, insurance companies were disbursing tens of millions of dollars to property owners who faced damages due to the 911 attacks. (even though technically, they should not have done so) because these were acts of war, which are typically excluded from coverage in most insurance policies. Simultaneously, the currency comptroller was blocking insurance firms from competing with credit card companies in the credit card debt suspension insurance market. This led to a monopoly on credit card debt suspension insurance by the credit card companies, with premium rates inflated by 1000% to 2000%. The profit margins were so excessive that the CFPB had to penalize credit card companies more than 500 million dollars in the summer of 2012 due to their aggressive sales and marketing of credit card debt suspension insurance. Back in 2008, I cautioned about the overpriced credit card debt suspension insurance through the establishment of __URL__ but my efforts were never rewarded. Consequently, most credit card defaults in the U.S. over the past decade and a half were grounded on a fraudulent basis of excessively priced credit card debt suspension insurance, which consumers found unaffordable to maintain. Consumers were essentially paying for five years' worth of this insurance but only receiving coverage for three to five months! In many instances when a judge declared a credit card default, they were inadvertently endorsing the exorbitant pricing of a monopolistic insurance policy that failed to adequately safeguard consumers against defaults triggered by life-altering events. Rectifying this issue could potentially revitalize the U.S. economy almost instantaneously. The initial step involves acknowledging the fraud in credit card debt suspension insurance that has been inflicted upon Americans by credit card companies over the last 10 to 15 years. As a remedy, all consumer credit card debt should be reduced by approximately 65%. Subsequently, increase the monthly minimum payment on the remaining 35% from 2% to 5%. This adjustment keeps monthly payments roughly constant while allowing consumers to manage their debt more efficiently going forward. In 2005, the currency comptroller attempted to persuade credit card companies to raise their minimum monthly payments from 2% to 4 or 5%, but withdrew when it became apparent that many would default. By slashing consumer credit card debt by 65% as compensation for insurance fraud, consumers would suddenly face significantly less debt, while their monthly payments remain similar.

{"id": "id_678", "input": "In my opinion, the most pressing issue arises from financial institutions operating two separate systems that are not seamlessly connected. The first system is a record-keeping platform that holds detailed account information while the second is a charge-off system designed for monitoring activities post charge-off. Typically, events logged in the charge-off system don't get updated in the record-keeping system. Moreover, the charge-off system is neither employed nor intended for credit reporting purposes. Another issue stems from mergers or acquisitions where only the record-keeping system is integrated, neglecting the acquired charge-off system. This creates an informational gap regarding the account's status after it has been charged off. When accounts are outsourced or sold the dependency falls on the record-keeping system, rather than on the charge-off system. A third complication arises when a consumer holds multiple accounts with the original lender, increasing the likelihood that different accounts may be transferred to varying agencies or debt purchasers. Even if debt buyers and collectors can access the accounts, the activities recorded are typically absent from the record-keeping system, while the charge-off system might no longer be in use. The matter of credit reporting disputes hinges on whether data is provided to a credit reporting agency by the agency or debt buyer.

I consider it most favorable for consumers to allow lawsuits to be filed where the consumer currently lives, except when dealing with real estate, in which case it should occur where the property is situated. Regarding concerns about geographic size, many states are experiencing financial crises that impact the civil branches of state courts. In one of our largest districts, the available courts for filing suits were reduced from 32 to just 2. To ensure consumer protection in this area, I suggest incorporating a rule segment that prevents collectors from selecting a court venue with the aim of hindering the consumer's ability to engage in the legal process.

{"id": "id_709", "input": "Implementing this concept would be remarkable. At present, debt purchasers acquire debt at an average cost of four cents per dollar. Numerous debts are purchased for amounts ranging from two to four cents on the dollar. Additionally, many debts are transferred at no cost. As an initial lender, I would want to maximize the returns on the debt owed to me. Thus, if I could obtain ten cents directly from the debtor instead of four cents from a debt purchaser, I would certainly offer a considerably reduced settlement option to the debtor, which involves consumers bidding on their own debt. Currently, original lenders do not provide substantial discounts to debtors before selling for four cents on the dollar. Most creditors hardly offer debtors even a 10% reduction on the debt as a settlement. Certainly, creditors could swiftly dispose of debt portfolios to buyers by selling them at four cents on the dollar. However, creditors could potentially earn significantly more by providing a one-time opportunity at ten cents on the dollar or another appealing rate that exceeds four cents. The CFPB might consider establishing a regulation that grants consumers/debtors a limited-time opportunity, perhaps lasting 45 days from the date of the notification, to accept a substantially reduced rate from their creditors. This offer would have a short validity period and would inform the consumer that, if declined, the creditor would proceed to sell the debt to a buyer. Such a letter would only be dispatched if the creditor intends to sell the debt, rather than as another collection attempt. In this manner, consumers are given a final opportunity to settle their outstanding debt. Creditors incur fewer losses, gain higher profits, and can offer more loans, better rates, and thereby boost the economy. More money exchanging hands at higher values, like ten cents on the dollar compared to four, instead of sitting in accounts receivable indefinitely, stimulates economic growth. This policy would have no adverse effects and would bring benefits to everyone involved. A minor consequence could be the debt collection industry receiving fewer debts in their acquisition.

I was compelled to pay for filing a response, which was delayed by a day, and had to contest the default due to the lack of service. The judge concurred that the subservice was invalid since the service company used the most unremarkable description they could muster: a woman aged between mid-30s to late-40s, approximately 5 feet 4 inches tall, weighing around 130 to 150 pounds. That is one of the most vague descriptions imaginable, and it was utterly incorrect. because such a person did not exist. They even fabricated a name unfamiliar to me, and upon searching online, I found no traces of it. The second instance of a false subservice presented a description that closely resembled the initial one, and the supposed recipient of the subservice was labeled \"Jane Doe\". I wish to highlight how perilous these fabrications can be from another perspective. I have been solely responsible for providing caregiving services to my parents, with no other individuals involved. By falsifying information in court documents, there could be future allegations accusing me of exposing my parents to a non-existent person at our home. I was also somewhat paralyzed by the depth of this deception because on the rare occasions I needed to sue someone, I adhered to legal protocols and ensured proper service was conducted.

The CFPB simply needs to set up fundamental regulations that shield consumers and clearly state that the onus of proof lies with the creditor before any debt collector can be involved in pursuing such debts. The debt collector should be restricted to following particular protocols when carrying out their duties and the issue should be brought before a small claims court where both parties can present their arguments before a judgment is made, rather than allowing the claim to be reported to a credit reporting agency which would unjustly damage the consumer's credit score or rating without their awareness, which is completely unacceptable.

{"id": "id_781", "input": "I'm currently enduring a dreadful ordeal with a creditor and a debt collector. In 2004, I graduated from college and consolidated all my student loans through Nelnet. Around 2005, I began receiving calls from debt collectors claiming I was behind on my loan payments. I clarified that I had consistently made my payments to Nelnet and insisted on seeing evidence of the debt before making any further payments. However, I never received any such proof of the debt. This scenario repeated itself multiple times over the next five years. In 2011, I aimed to purchase my wife's dream home. This was a major financial commitment. The bankers I consulted informed me that resolving the student loan issue was necessary for approval. I contacted both the original creditor and the debt collector, pleading for some form of loan documentation. What they provided was simply a loan application, lacking any indication of approval or disbursement of funds. Although I was uneasy about the evidence provided, I realized that pursuing legal action would take more time than I was willing to invest. Therefore, I was careful in my discussions with the creditor and debt collector to ensure my credit report would be cleared upon paying the full amount of the supposed loan. I also recorded my conversations with both the creditor and the debt collector. I settled the original loan balance, but, as you might have anticipated, the original creditor refused to update my credit report. Even after supplying credit reporting agencies with proof of payment, they also declined to amend my credit report. To complicate matters further, after the debt was paid, the debt collector sent me a notice stating that several thousand dollars had been forgiven. I promptly contacted the debt collector, requesting documentation to support their claimed amount, including proof of agreed interest rates. No reply from the debt collector. Currently, I'm disputing the issue with the IRS regarding possible additional taxes. And, despite having paid the debt two years prior, my credit report remains unchanged.

In my experience, the only time SOL issues become ambiguous is when a consumer relocates to a state with a different SOL. Clarity must be provided in these specific situations. This is because once a debtor relocates, both parties argue for the SOL that best suits their interests. A national SOL would primarily serve the interests of debt collectors, not consumers. It is essential to focus on developing a mutually beneficial solution for both debt collectors and consumers. Implementing a national SOL of 7 years, as proposed by ACA International, undermines state laws, some of which have an SOL of 3 years or even less. The purpose of an SOL is to provide resolution. In reality, if a debt collector or owner cannot settle their clients' issues within the existing state SOL, extending it or establishing a national SOL only allows further consumer harassment. Three years is indeed sufficient time to initiate legal action. Just as criminal defendants have the right to a swift trial, consumers who may or may not be aware of their outstanding debts should be entitled to the same.

Dispatching notices within the 30-day period could lead to confusion if the consumer responds solely to the debt's validity and overlooks requesting credit report accuracy.

In my view, they ought not to do so. I've observed that ambiguity in regulations often leads to confusion.

It's important to remember that in 2002, the comptroller of the currency stopped the insurance sector from competing with credit card companies in providing credit card debt suspension insurance. This led to credit card companies obtaining a glaring monopoly on the overpriced premiums for credit card debt suspension insurance, which they imposed on their customers, who otherwise could have had policies to freeze interest charges temporarily during a major life emergency. Financial literacy plays a crucial role when considering the 2% monthly minimum payment trap set for first-time credit card users. These 2% monthly minimum payments are essentially akin to a drug dealer offering free samples to hook customers on their product. For instance, someone could purchase a $1,000 high-end television and only be required to pay $20 or $25 the following month. In my view, that's akin to credit card addiction. To enhance Financial Literacy, credit card agreements could include warnings in bold letters about how credit cards deliberately maintain low monthly minimum payments to entice individuals into accruing more debt, their lack of empathy for significant life events, and the exorbitant overpricing of credit card debt suspension insurance by up to 2,000%. These three warnings should be prominently displayed in bold on every agreement, and this would result in two outcomes: consumers would have a better opportunity to achieve financial literacy, and it would also acknowledge the fraudulent actions by credit card companies regarding their existing agreements.

This serves as a major source of confusion concerning debt collection and legal jurisdiction. Establishing a more uniform set of guidelines could mitigate these issues.

Moreover, ACA's 2011 initiative, \"The Path Forward: ACA International's Blueprint for Modernizing America's Consumer Debt Collection System,\" also supported the idea of a national statute of limitations. This is an aspect that both sides within the industry concur on. Having 50 states each with their own statutes creates excessive confusion for consumers.

{"id": "id_914", "input": "I advocate for a regulation that forbids debt collectors, debt purchasers, and related entities from accessing a debtor's credit report once the debt is legally time-barred and beyond the statute of limitations. Additionally, there should be a distinct rule that differentiates between 'hard pull' and 'soft pull' credit inquiries. For several years, I have opted out of promotional marketing through the __URL__ website. I do not have any debt and have never been indebted. However, I do possess a common name, which means that occasionally, various debt collectors and debt purchasers 'soft pull' my credit reports while attempting to find someone they are searching for. Such actions should be prohibited even if the debt is still collectable and within the statute of limitations. Debt collectors lack a 'permissible purpose' to arbitrarily 'soft pull' my credit reports merely because I have a common name. Regarding debts that are outside the statute of limitations and time-barred: debt collectors and debt purchasers should not be permitted to access someone's credit report since they are not legally allowed to sue the debtor outside of the statute of limitations. Therefore, there is no justification for continuing to access someone's credit report. Concerning 'hard pull' versus 'soft pull': there should be explicit language preventing debt collectors, debt purchasers, and related affiliates from conducting 'hard pull' credit inquiries. The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) clearly defines what constitutes 'permissible purposes' but it does not specifically differentiate between a 'hard pull' and a 'soft pull' credit inquiry. A 'hard pull' is initiated by the consumer when requesting a credit extension. Any request not initiated by the consumer is categorized as a 'soft pull.' However, repeatedly, I hear from friends, family, and online community members who share experiences of debt collectors or debt purchasers conducting 'hard pulls' on their credit reports. Some instances occur when the debt is time-barred as it falls outside the statute of limitations and the Credit Reporting Time Period. This practice is unacceptable. A 'hard pull' can lower a consumer's credit score and remains visible for up to 25 months to anyone with a legitimate permissible purpose to view that consumer's credit report. Conducting a 'hard pull' on a debtor's credit report may infringe upon the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) in terms of debtor privacy. Debt collectors, debt purchasers, and related entities should be barred from performing 'hard pulls' and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) should make this unequivocally clear. www.optoutprescreen.com __URL__", "topic": null, "demo_id": "01068", "framework": "cdcp", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 0, "to": 211}], "label": "policy", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 212, "to": 331}], "label": "policy", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 332, "to": 421}], "label": "testimony", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 422, "to": 474}], "label": "testimony", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 475, "to": 511}], "label": "value", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 512, "to": 673}], "label": "testimony", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 674, "to": 784}], "label": "policy", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 785, "to": 911}], "label": "fact", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 912, "to": 1082}], "label": "policy", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1083, "to": 1174}], "label": "fact", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1175, "to": 1261}], "label": "value", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1262, "to": 1452}], "label": "policy", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1453, "to": 1545}], "label": "value", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1546, "to": 1644}], "label": "fact", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1645, "to": 1723}], "label": "fact", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1724, "to": 1798}], "label": "fact", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1799, "to": 1986}], "label": "testimony", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1987, "to": 2121}], "label": "testimony", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2122, "to": 2152}], "label": "value", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2153, "to": 2329}], "label": "fact", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2330, "to": 2475}], "label": "fact", "id": 20}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2476, "to": 2576}], "label": "policy", "id": 21}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2577, "to": 2666}], "label": "policy", "id": 22}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2667, "to": 2698}], "label": "reference", "id": 23}], "edges": [{"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 8, "target": 10, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 10, "target": 9, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 11, "target": 12, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 21, "target": 19, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 21, "target": 20, "label": "CDCP_reason"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23]}

{"id": "id_923", "input": "Numerous conflicts are challenging to probe into due to the vagueness surrounding the exact nature of the consumer's complaint. When a consumer provides specific details that allow us to identify a clear issue to research, we proceed accordingly. Conversely, if the complaint is ambiguous\u2014like \"I dispute this debt\" or \"This debt isn't mine\" (a very common occurrence)\u2014we tend to provide statements or contracts to attempt resolution. The depth of our investigation heavily depends on the level of detail shared by the consumer, and it often leads us to base our resolution efforts on the documentation supplied by the creditor. Occasionally, we might need to request that the creditor investigates their records for specific evidence of X, Y, or Z, although more often than not, disputes lack such specificity. In my experience, we frequently ask consumers to provide evidence supporting their claims (such as payment receipts), but often, they fail to do so, leaving us unable to pursue further investigation. Mandating only a \"reasonable\" inquiry without a clear definition seems like passing the responsibility to the courts to define it after extensive legal proceedings. I believe starting with a general framework for acquiring documentation that substantiates the claim that the consumer owes the debt, the amount, and the creditor is advisable. I would appreciate if consumers could utilize a standard letter from the CFPB that outlines various disputes, aiding them in articulating their issues more clearly. One of the most significant challenges for collectors (and a common complaint from those being pursued) is handling situations where individuals claim the debt belongs to another person with the same name. We diligently conduct our investigations (attempting to match the last 4 digits of the social security number, running a skip trace to verify if the contacted individual resided at the address on the statements, etc.), and we provide verification, yet, in our increasingly mobile society, confirming that the John Smith we reached is indeed the one liable for the debt can be quite challenging. This becomes even more complicated when there's no clear indication that we've contacted the wrong person. We strive to avoid reaching out to incorrect individuals regarding a debt, but unfortunately, it does happen because consumers sometimes fail to update creditors with their new contact information, leaving collectors to rely on the most accurate information they have. Regrettably, I am unsure how to address this issue effectively.

{"id": "id_951", "input": "Debt collectors initiate a high volume of default judgments primarily because consumers choose not to engage, rather than being oblivious to the situation. Typically, when a lawsuit is commenced, debt collectors have already tried to settle the matter through phone calls and/or letters. This doesn't even factor in the attempts made by the original creditor. Lawsuits are never the initial course of action. They are generally pursued only after numerous unsuccessful attempts to negotiate with a consumer to clear an outstanding debt. A default judgment is merely a continuation of this process. Even after we file a lawsuit, efforts might be made to contact the consumer and resolve the matter before a judgment is issued. I have encountered numerous instances where we informed the consumer about their option to respond, yet they still did not. In my view, default judgments are largely due to consumers' conscious decision not to participate in the process, rather than any deceptive tactics by collectors. I would note that many states have rules stating that if a consumer doesn't respond to a summons and defaults, they don't have to be informed about a motion for a default judgment. Thus, the entry of the judgment might indeed be unexpected, even though the summons warns that a judgment may be entered if no response is made. Nevertheless, an attorney adhering to local regulations is not acting in a deceptive manner. To mitigate this unexpected outcome for consumers who don't respond, it might be beneficial to require that all motions for judgment be served on the consumer, regardless of local rules suggesting otherwise. It's worth mentioning that many motions for default judgment aren't scheduled for a hearing. They can simply be submitted for a decision without a court appearance. Regarding what is needed to support a default judgment, requirements differ from court to court and judge to judge. In my experience, courts that demand more documentation typically look for affidavits of debt, charge-off statements, records of payments or charges, and assignment documents (if the plaintiff is a debt buyer).", "topic": null, "demo_id": "00686", "framework": "cdcp", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 0, "to": 59}], "label": "fact", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 60, "to": 155}], "label": "value", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 156, "to": 287}], "label": "value", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 288, "to": 359}], "label": "value", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 360, "to": 408}], "label": "fact", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 409, "to": 536}], "label": "value", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 537, "to": 597}], "label": "value", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 598, "to": 725}], "label": "value", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 726, "to": 849}], "label": "testimony", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 850, "to": 1012}], "label": "value", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1013, "to": 1193}], "label": "value", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1194, "to": 1338}], "label": "value", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1339, "to": 1431}], "label": "value", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1432, "to": 1639}], "label": "value", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1640, "to": 1732}], "label": "value", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1733, "to": 1804}], "label": "value", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1805, "to": 1920}], "label": "fact", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1921, "to": 2131}], "label": "testimony", "id": 17}], "edges": [{"source": 0, "target": 1, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 4, "target": 5, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 11, "target": 10, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 14, "target": 15, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 16, "target": 17, "label": "CDCP_evidence"}], "tops": [0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16]}

At present, when you challenge a debt, the debt collector flags you to the credit reporting agencies and this negatively affects your credit score; in essence, the harm has already been inflicted. To put it another way, the indication that the consumer disputes the debt on their credit report is mostly disregarded by potential lenders, employers, landlords, and others. Therefore, disputing the debt does not effectively shield the consumer from damage. Debt collectors and creditors use the threat of reporting you to credit agencies as a pressure tactic to compel repayment even when you may genuinely not owe the debt or the amount claimed. Regarding my suggestion, I believe it will not result in increased litigation. Quite the contrary. If a consumer does not challenge the debt in a timely manner, then it can be classified as verified or substantiated. However, if the debt is contested promptly, creditors and debt collectors will need to decide whether to pursue legal action and assess their chances of winning in court, potentially leading them to be more selective about which debts to litigate. This proposal would also protect consumers from having their credit scores affected until it is definitively established that a contested debt is genuinely owed and the exact amount is confirmed. Alternatively, a regulation could be enacted imposing heavy statutory penalties, triple damages, and recovery of legal fees against creditors, debt collectors, and credit reporting agencies if the consumer proves the disputed debt is non-existent or the debt's amount is less than claimed. However, this method places the responsibility of proof on the consumer and I firmly believe that the responsibility of proof should lie with creditors and debt collectors to definitively establish the existence and amount of any contested debt before negatively impacting a consumer's credit report.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "01110", "framework": "cdcp", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 0, "to": 363}], "label": "policy", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 364, "to": 464}], "label": "fact", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 465, "to": 560}], "label": "fact", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 561, "to": 735}], "label": "value", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 736, "to": 819}], "label": "value", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 820, "to": 941}], "label": "value", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 942, "to": 1009}], "label": "value", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1010, "to": 1108}], "label": "value", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1109, "to": 1226}], "label": "value", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1227, "to": 1474}], "label": "value", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1475, "to": 1670}], "label": "value", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1671, "to": 1960}], "label": "value", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1961, "to": 2032}], "label": "value", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2033, "to": 2261}], "label": "policy", "id": 13}], "edges": [{"source": 0, "target": 7, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 0, "target": 8, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 0, "target": 9, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 4, "target": 1, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 7, "target": 9, "label": "CDCP_reason"}], "tops": [0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13]}

{"id": "id_1002", "input": "For the initial inquiry, conducting thorough research is essential. Although collectors might still pursue legal actions, which seems unlikely to cease, a penalty should be imposed on them if they file a false claim. In situations where litigation is initiated against an incorrect individual, the entity responsible should compensate the victim with a reasonable amount and also pay a significant fee to the overseeing authority to assist in covering supervision costs. Regarding the second question, I assume that a vast majority of consumer debts can be settled. Nevertheless, there will always be exceptions to this rule. In instances where debt recovery is impossible for any reason, it should be considered genuinely uncollectible and prohibited from being resold as collectible debt. A precise definition and refinement of what constitutes \"Uncollectible\" must be established by the relevant regulatory agency. For the third question, assessments should be made for both parties. Currently, credit reporting agencies are in place to track the consumer aspect of this issue, and a numerical evaluation score could be added to the consumer's existing credit report. This could serve as an initial step that can be developed further as the system is refined. Conversely, collectors would necessitate a novel assessment mechanism to evaluate both the company overall and the individuals involved in debt resolution efforts. For successful models of such systems, I would refer you to the Department of Transportation's Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and their Compliance-Safety-Accountability framework. Admittedly, their system is far more intricate and comprehensive than what the debt industry would demand. Yet, their scoring system is adaptable and can accommodate future modifications. It would also enable evaluation of the original creditor. Such evaluations would offer the government and investors better insights into the risk level of a particular business. Incorporating Mr. Bartmann's suggestions would create a framework where collectors and financial institutions self-regulate to attain ethical and accountable outcomes, avoiding the defense of legality. This would benefit both parties and help numerous consumers escape the vicious cycle of debt.

{"id": "id_1058", "input": "I work as a clerk at the city's local court. I handle civil cases and I believe that the laws regarding debt collection treat debtors quite unfairly. The Court is prohibited from providing legal counsel which makes it distressing to try to explain and comfort distressed litigants who are unaware of what awaits them. I advocate for more options for pro se litigants who cannot afford private legal representation (which applies to 95% of the litigants in my area). It's apparent that most individuals do not respond to summonses because they were either not served properly, simply ignore them, or mostly, don't comprehend the legal jargon. However, I do receive numerous calls from litigants inquiring about the steps to take once they have been served. When individuals do submit responses, they are often in letter format rather than a 'legal' verified response. Debt collection lawyers typically seize this opportunity to seek summary judgment. Our Court accepts letters without hesitation, and we forward a copy to the attorney, arranging a pre-trial meeting with a judge or court attorney to facilitate a resolution between the parties. The Court must follow a schedule for these meetings, but we maintain flexibility and if a defendant has scheduling issues, we strive to accommodate them as best as possible. When summonses are submitted to the court, half are packed with debt details, while others only state the amount owed. In my experience, it's sometimes challenging for litigants to obtain additional proof from attorneys, even when the court mandates it. When processing default judgments, I meticulously review the entire file, comparing the summons/complaint and the submitted default judgment, double-checking the affidavit of service for the summons (to verify the defendant had adequate time to respond), and ensuring the default judgment is accompanied by proper documentation such as debt purchase proof, a non-military affidavit, etc. I also verify that the correct interest rate and court fees are being applied. Ultimately, debtors lack sufficient laws to safeguard them, and the Court is constrained by these regulations, even if there was a desire to assist, it would be impossible.

{"id": "id_1062", "input": "Although Option 1 appears to be the most straightforward, there are complexities that aren't immediately obvious. Who decides what the term \"principal\" actually refers to? In the case of revolving credit accounts, interest accumulates (as finance charges) and becomes part of the total balance. Thus, does \"principal\" imply only the part of the balance that the cardholder charged (which is extremely challenging, if not impossible, for a collector to determine) or the complete charged-off amount? I acknowledge that managing various types of debts can be challenging. However, I believe this approach is impractical for a significant segment of consumer debt.

{"id": "id_1116", "input": "Collectors have the duty to reconnect with customers who are overdue and provide them with solutions to repay their loans, irrespective of the technology they employ. In the field of collections, using automated dialing systems significantly enhances a collector's ability to reach customers who have defaulted and are reluctant to contact their creditors. These automated dialing systems are utilized in various sectors apart from debt recovery: telemarketers employ them to contact potential clients, while schools use them to inform parents about closures due to bad weather. The underlying technology remains identical however, the intention varies depending on who is using it. Under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), creditors are forbidden from using automated dialing systems to contact cell phones without obtaining the customer's consent. The initial aim of the TCPA, which was to shield consumers from incurring excessive charges due to automated calls, has shifted towards preventing an excessive number of call attempts to numbers that are typically linked directly to the customer. This does not alter the fundamental objective of collection calls, it just reduces the overall efficiency of the process. Restricting which numbers can be reached using automated dialing systems contradicts the increasing trend of households relying solely on wireless services. The Center for Disease Control's latest 'Wireless Substitution' report (Early release data, July-December 2012) reveals that over a third (36%) of American adults reside in homes with only wireless phone service, a number that rises to 45% among children in the US. With an annual growth rate averaging 34%, it is likely that by 2020, only a small portion of adults in the country will live in homes with a landline phone that can be autodialed. The CFPB ought to permit the autodialing of all phone numbers given by the customer, without imposing complex consent requirements.

Email applications include privacy and security features intended to prevent senders from knowing if and when an email has been accessed. The issue arises because senders have found ways to bypass these privacy measures. This technique is frequently exploited by spammers and cybercriminals. Experts on spam advise against opening emails that appear to be or are suspected to be spam, as spammers are adept at circumventing privacy and security settings, thereby compelling the recipient's email client to notify the sender when an email is opened. Moreover, I am uncomfortable with the notion that data collectors can embed links within emails. Less ethical collectors and employees might insert links that jeopardize user security or are offensive to recipients, such as links to explicit content. Consider how many collectors, despite numerous lawsuits, continue to use offensive and abusive language over the phone, and imagine the potential damage these unethical individuals could inflict through emails. I also have reservations about emails due to how easily collection agencies can sell email lists to marketing firms. Several decades back, a neighbor of mine worked as a debt collector. She used to say that if they couldn't recover money from debtors, they would profit by selling the debtor's address and personal details to marketing firms. I am greatly concerned about permitting collectors to use emails. Any regulations allowing collectors to utilize email should be implemented with careful consideration of privacy and security, the nature of materials and content, and limitations on the sale of email lists. I am also apprehensive about ensuring the authenticity of emails. Spammers and hackers can alter how emails appear and the name associated with the sending email address.

{"id": "id_1153", "input": "Perhaps the most blatant misconduct related to credit card debt happened in 2002, curiously soon after the events of 9/11. At that time, insurance companies were disbursing tens of millions of dollars to property owners who had incurred damage due to 9/11 (which, strictly speaking, they weren't obliged to do because such acts of war are typically not covered under most insurance policies), the office of the comptroller of the currency was barring insurance companies from competing with credit card firms in the market for credit card debt suspension insurance. This led to a monopoly for credit card companies in the credit card debt suspension insurance sector, with premiums marked up by an astonishing 1000% to 2000%. The profit margins were so excessive that the CFPB had to impose fines exceeding $500 million on credit card companies in the summer of 2012 for their aggressive tactics in selling and marketing credit card debt suspension insurance. I had issued warnings about the inflated prices of credit card debt suspension insurance back in 2008 when I established __URL__ but my efforts were never recognized or rewarded. As a result, the majority of credit card defaults in the U.S. over the past 10 to 15 years were rooted in a fraudulent system of outrageously expensive credit card debt suspension insurance that consumers couldn't sustainably afford. Consumers ended up paying for five years' worth of credit card debt suspension insurance but only received benefits covering 3 to 5 months. More often than not, when judges declared a credit card default, they were endorsing the inflated costs of a monopolistic credit card debt suspension insurance policy that failed to provide consumers with a straightforward way to shield themselves from defaults triggered by significant life events. We could practically revitalize the U.S. economy almost immediately by taking the morally correct actions. First, recognize the credit card debt suspension insurance fraud that credit card companies have inflicted on Americans over the past decade or more and then, as a form of redress, reduce consumer credit card debt by approximately 65%. Subsequently, increase the monthly minimum payment on the remaining 35% from 2% to 5% so that the monthly payment remains roughly constant, yet consumers can see their debt diminishing more readily. The comptroller of the currency attempted to persuade credit card companies to raise their minimum monthly payment requirements from 2% to 4 or 5% around 2005, but withdrew when it became evident that too many individuals would default. By cutting consumer credit card debt by 65% as compensation for debt suspension insurance deceit, consumers suddenly find themselves with significantly less debt but still need to make comparable monthly payments.

The CFPB's funding mechanism bypasses congressional appropriation as its budget is secured via transfers from the Federal Reserve.

Regarding regulations, I believe one call per week should suffice. The purpose of the automated call is to keep the debt fresh in the consumer's mind so that they remember to pay once they have the means.

{"id": "id_1201", "input": "In my opinion, the primary challenge arises from financial institutions operating two systems that are not completely integrated. The first is the system of record, which holds information at the account level. The second is a charge-off system designed to monitor events following an account's charge-off. Typically, events recorded in the charge-off system are not communicated back to the system of record. Additionally, the charge-off system is not utilized for credit reporting purposes. Another issue emerges from mergers or acquisitions, where only the system of record is converted, leaving the acquired charge-off system unchanged. This creates a gap regarding the specific status after an account has been charged off. When accounts are outsourced or sold, the system of record becomes the primary source of information, rather than the charge-off system. A third complication arises when a consumer has multiple accounts with the original lender, increasing the likelihood that one account might be transferred to a different agency or debt buyer. Even if debt buyers and collectors have access, the activities related to the account are often absent from the system of record, and the charge-off system might have been shut down. The matter of credit reporting in disputes is contingent on whether an agency or debt buyer provides information to a credit reporting agency. Currently and historically, the volume of consumer data reported to credit agencies may not be precise concerning charged-off accounts, and demanding a chain of title would be costly, with accuracy still being uncertain.

In my opinion, the option that best serves consumers is to allow legal actions to be initiated in the area where the consumer resides at the start of the lawsuit (except for cases involving real estate, which should be dealt with where the property is situated). Regarding the challenges of geographical size, it's crucial to recognize that numerous states are experiencing budget shortfalls impacting the civil divisions within the state court systems. For instance, in one of our largest districts, the number of courts available for filing lawsuits has drastically decreased from 32 to just 2.

{"id": "id_1232", "input": "This concept is excellent. Currently, debt buyers purchase debt at an average cost of 4 cents per dollar. Numerous debts are acquired for 2-4 cents per dollar. Additionally, many other debts are handed over without charge. As an original creditor, my goal would be to maximize the recovery from a debt owed to me. Therefore, if I could collect 10 cents per dollar directly from the debtor instead of receiving 4 cents per dollar from a debt buyer, I would be inclined to offer the debtor a considerably reduced debt settlement rate (or, as you refer to it, permitting consumers to bid on their own debt). At present, original creditors do not offer significant rate reductions to debtors before selling debts for 4 cents per dollar. Most creditors scarcely offer debtors a 10% reduction on the debt as a settlement proposal. Certainly, a creditor might swiftly transfer portfolios to debt buyers by selling them for 4 cents per dollar. However, creditors could earn substantially more by presenting a one-time opportunity at 10 cents per dollar (or an equally enticing offer that exceeds 4 cents per dollar). The CFPB could consider implementing a regulation permitting consumers/debtors to receive a one-time offer, valid for a specified period (perhaps 45 days), from the date a letter is sent by creditors offering a significantly reduced rate. This offer would be available for a limited time and would also inform the consumer that, if the offer is declined, the creditor will sell the debt to a debt buyer. This letter would only be dispatched if the creditor intends to sell the debt, rather than merely attempting to collect once more. This approach provides consumers with one last opportunity to settle the debt. Meanwhile, creditors experience fewer losses, greater profits, can extend more credit to consumers, offer better rates, and stimulate economic growth. The economy benefits when more money exchanges hands at higher values (10 cents per dollar compared to 4 cents per dollar) instead of remaining uncollected in accounts receivable indefinitely. This rule would not have any adverse effects and would only bring positive outcomes for all. A minor consequence might be the debt collection industry acquiring fewer debts in their portfolios, yet this minor drawback is outweighed by the substantial positive impacts on the economy.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "01144", "framework": "cdcp", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 0, "to": 26}], "label": "value", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 27, "to": 105}], "label": "fact", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 106, "to": 159}], "label": "fact", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 160, "to": 222}], "label": "fact", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 223, "to": 313}], "label": "value", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 314, "to": 604}], "label": "value", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 605, "to": 732}], "label": "fact", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 733, "to": 824}], "label": "fact", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 825, "to": 935}], "label": "value", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 936, "to": 1108}], "label": "value", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1109, "to": 1347}], "label": "policy", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1348, "to": 1512}], "label": "policy", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1513, "to": 1643}], "label": "policy", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1644, "to": 1722}], "label": "value", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1723, "to": 1873}], "label": "value", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1874, "to": 2066}], "label": "value", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2067, "to": 2159}], "label": "value", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2160, "to": 2260}], "label": "value", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2261, "to": 2350}], "label": "value", "id": 18}], "edges": [{"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 12, "target": 14, "label": "CDCP_reason"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18]}

We must not permit convenience to rob us of these essential rights. I understand there is something called the Gideon Decision by the Supreme Court that guarantees any accused person the right to a proper defense, therefore, if any debt-collector or creditor denies the accused debtor the right to a court hearing or a fair defense, CFPB attorneys should strictly penalize such offenders. The rules established by the CFPB must ensure that no alleged debtor is coerced into repayment or misled by the court into doing so. Often, there are valid reasons for unpaid bills and consumers should have the opportunity to challenge the creditor and address any grievances before settling the payments. Actually, it's quite a straightforward situation.

Debt-collectors should be allowed to operate only within specific guidelines and disputes should be taken to a small claims court, allowing both parties to present their arguments before the court makes a decision, rather than reporting the claim to a credit agency prematurely which would unfairly damage the consumer's credit score without their knowledge, a practice that is unequivocally wrong.

{"id": "id_1304", "input": "I'm currently embroiled in a distressing situation with a lender and a debt collection agency. In 2004, I graduated from college and consolidated all my student loans with Nelnet. Around 2005, I began receiving calls from debt collectors claiming that I was behind on my loan payments. I explained that I had consistently made payments through Nelnet and requested proof of the debt before making any further payments. No evidence of the debt was ever provided to me. This scenario played out multiple times over the next five years. In 2011, I aimed to purchase my wife's dream house. It was a major financial commitment. Bankers informed me that resolving the student loan issue was crucial for loan approval. I contacted both the original lender and the debt collector, pleading for evidence of the loan. They sent me a loan application, which lacked any indication of approval or fund disbursement. Although the evidence was unsatisfactory, I realized that a legal battle would be too time-consuming. Therefore, I made sure in my discussions with the lender and debt collector that paying the full amount of the supposed loan would clear the issue from my credit record. I also recorded the conversations with the lender and debt collector. I settled the original loan amount and, unsurprisingly, the lender refused to update my credit report. Even after providing proof to credit agencies that the debt was settled, they declined to update my credit report as well. To make things worse, after settling the debt, I received notice from the debt collector stating that thousands of dollars had been forgiven. I promptly contacted the debt collector, asking for documentation to justify the amount, including confirmation of any agreed interest rate. No response was received.

We must remember that in 2002, it was the comptroller of the currency who stopped the Insurance industry from entering the credit card debt suspension insurance market, leaving it to the credit card companies. This action enabled credit card firms to dominate with an excessive monopoly on the costly credit card debt suspension insurance premiums they imposed on their customers, who could have otherwise secured insurance policies to pause interest rates during significant life emergencies. Financial literacy is a crucial factor in the deceptive 2% monthly minimum payment scheme targeted at novice credit card users. The 2% monthly minimum payments are akin to a drug dealer offering free samples to addict consumers to their product. An individual can purchase a $1,000 high-end television and have just a $20 or $25 payment due the following month. In my view, that's like a credit card addiction. Financial Literacy could be promoted by mandating that every credit card agreement prominently displays warnings about the intentionally low monthly minimum payments that trap users in escalating debt, the lack of empathy for major life events from credit card companies, and the exorbitant overcharging for debt suspension insurance, sometimes up to 2,000%. These three warnings should be prominently featured in bold on every agreement, resulting in two outcomes: consumers would have a higher likelihood of achieving financial literacy, and it would also signify an acknowledgment of past fraudulent practices by the credit card companies for existing agreements.

Eventually, I hired a lawyer and after months of legal wrangling, I received a modest settlement. This ordeal occurred while I was undergoing chemotherapy for cancer and was extremely unwell. These practices made my life unbearable for those months. Debt collectors should be banned from hiding their identity or their callback numbers. This situation arose because I had relocated and was assigned a new number that previously belonged to multiple people with unpaid debts. I was hesitant to change my number again fearing it would bring a new wave of debt collectors. There should be significantly harsher financial penalties for such violations. The offender in this scenario was a national collection agency with substantial annual income; the small amount I eventually received was negligible to them, equivalent to a fraction of a cent compared to their annual profits. Being an attorney myself, I checked their name on Pacer\u2014 they had faced numerous lawsuits in both state and federal courts and had paid million-dollar fines to state attorneys general\u2014still, these were mere operational costs for them compared to their vast annual revenues. We need to enforce much stricter penalties. These individuals are like cyber bullies with no ethical standards. At the very least, they should be mandated to display their identity on caller ID with a valid callback number, and the use of automated calls should be banned.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "01280", "framework": "cdcp", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 0, "to": 174}], "label": "testimony", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 175, "to": 211}], "label": "testimony", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 212, "to": 260}], "label": "testimony", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 261, "to": 294}], "label": "testimony", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 295, "to": 451}], "label": "testimony", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 452, "to": 481}], "label": "testimony", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 482, "to": 523}], "label": "testimony", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 524, "to": 564}], "label": "testimony", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 565, "to": 621}], "label": "value", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 622, "to": 681}], "label": "testimony", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 682, "to": 749}], "label": "testimony", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 750, "to": 781}], "label": "testimony", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 782, "to": 810}], "label": "testimony", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 811, "to": 879}], "label": "testimony", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 880, "to": 973}], "label": "testimony", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 974, "to": 1031}], "label": "value", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1032, "to": 1118}], "label": "policy", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1119, "to": 1139}], "label": "testimony", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1140, "to": 1256}], "label": "testimony", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1257, "to": 1297}], "label": "value", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1298, "to": 1351}], "label": "value", "id": 20}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1352, "to": 1430}], "label": "policy", "id": 21}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1431, "to": 1525}], "label": "fact", "id": 22}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1526, "to": 1657}], "label": "testimony", "id": 23}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1658, "to": 1714}], "label": "testimony", "id": 24}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1715, "to": 1931}], "label": "testimony", "id": 25}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1932, "to": 1975}], "label": "policy", "id": 26}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1976, "to": 2043}], "label": "value", "id": 27}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2044, "to": 2155}], "label": "policy", "id": 28}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2156, "to": 2204}], "label": "policy", "id": 29}], "edges": [{"source": 7, "target": 6, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 16, "target": 15, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 17, "target": 18, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 19, "target": 20, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 21, "target": 23, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 26, "target": 23, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 26, "target": 25, "label": "CDCP_reason"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29]}

Your bill is unpaid. I work for a debt collection agency.\" I responded, \"I've never seen a bill.\" He seemed surprised, saying \"really?\" I insisted, \"yes\" He advised me, \"Contact the hospital's accounting department.\" Upon calling the hospital, they directed me to consult my insurance company. My second insurance provider confirmed that both my insurance plans had settled the hospital's charges. The second insurance company mentioned that I owed a small amount on the bill, approximately $1.08. A debt collection agency had been engaged to recover $1.08, yet I had never received any billing! I requested both insurance companies to send me additional copies of the Explanation of Benefits. After receiving the copies, I forwarded them to the hospital's billing department along with a check for the amount the second insurance company indicated I owed. I never did receive a bill.

{"id": "id_1437", "input": "I propose a regulation that forbids debt collectors, debt owners or buyers, and associated parties from accessing a debtor's credit report once the debt is officially time-barred and outside the statute of limitations. Additionally, I recommend establishing a rule that clearly differentiates between \"hard pull\" and \"soft pull\" credit inquiries. For years, I've opted out of promotional marketing through the __URL__ website. I am free of debt and have never been in debt. However, I do possess a name that is quite common, and as a result, occasionally, various debt collectors and debt buyers conduct \"soft pulls\" on my credit reports while attempting to find whoever they are searching for. This should be prohibited, even if the debt remains collectible and within the statute of limitations. Debt collectors lack a \"permissible purpose\" to indiscriminately \"soft pull\" my credit reports merely due to my common name. Regarding debts that are outside the statute of limitations and time-barred: no debt collector or debt owner/buyer should be allowed to access someone's credit report since they are unable to legally pursue the debtor once the statute of limitations has expired. Therefore, there is no justification to persist in pulling someone's credit report. Regarding \"hard pull\" and \"soft pull\" inquiries: It is essential to have explicit language that forbids debt collectors, debt owners or buyers, and related affiliates from conducting \"hard pull\" credit report inquiries. The FCRA outlines \"permissible purposes\" clearly but does not provide a specific distinction between \"hard pull\" and \"soft pull\" credit inquiries. A \"hard pull\" occurs when a consumer initiates a request for credit extension. Any request that is not initiated by the consumer is classified as a \"soft pull.\" Yet repeatedly, friends, family, and online forum members have informed me and provided evidence that debt collectors or debt owners/buyers have \"hard pulled\" their credit reports. Moreover, some instances occur when the debt is time-barred due to being outside the statute of limitations and the Credit Reporting Time Period. Such practices are intolerable. A \"hard pull\" can lower a consumer's credit score and remain visible for up to 25 months to anyone with a legitimate permissible purpose to view that consumer's credit report. Conducting a \"hard pull\" on a debtor's credit report could potentially violate the FDCPA by infringing on the debtor's privacy. Debt collectors, debt owners/buyers, and their affiliates should be banned from performing \"hard pulls\" and the CFPB should clarify this unequivocally. www.optoutprescreen.com __URL__", "topic": null, "demo_id": "01068", "framework": "cdcp", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 0, "to": 218}], "label": "policy", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 219, "to": 346}], "label": "policy", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 347, "to": 426}], "label": "testimony", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 427, "to": 473}], "label": "testimony", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 474, "to": 524}], "label": "value", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 525, "to": 694}], "label": "testimony", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 695, "to": 797}], "label": "policy", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 798, "to": 922}], "label": "fact", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 923, "to": 1089}], "label": "policy", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1090, "to": 1185}], "label": "fact", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1186, "to": 1269}], "label": "value", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1270, "to": 1489}], "label": "policy", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1490, "to": 1538}], "label": "value", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1539, "to": 1636}], "label": "fact", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1637, "to": 1715}], "label": "fact", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1716, "to": 1797}], "label": "fact", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1798, "to": 1978}], "label": "testimony", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1979, "to": 2124}], "label": "testimony", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2125, "to": 2156}], "label": "value", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2157, "to": 2332}], "label": "fact", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2333, "to": 2460}], "label": "fact", "id": 20}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2461, "to": 2564}], "label": "policy", "id": 21}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2565, "to": 2612}], "label": "policy", "id": 22}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2613, "to": 2644}], "label": "reference", "id": 23}], "edges": [{"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 8, "target": 10, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 10, "target": 9, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 11, "target": 12, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 21, "target": 19, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 21, "target": 20, "label": "CDCP_reason"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 22, 23]}

{"id": "id_1446", "input": "Investigating many disputes poses significant challenges mainly due to the ambiguity surrounding the consumer's actual grievance. When a consumer provides enough specificity for a clear research target, we proceed with the investigation. But if the dispute is vague, such as claims like \"I dispute this debt\" or \"I don't owe this debt\" (which occur quite frequently), we tend to supply statements or a contract to try and address the issue. The extent of the investigation is primarily determined by the level of detail shared by the consumer, and often, this leads us to depend on the documentation provided by the creditor to settle the dispute. There are instances when we may need to request the creditor to search their records for evidence of certain information, although typically, the dispute lacks such specificity. In my experience, we frequently request consumers to supply information to back their dispute (like proof of payment), but often they fail to do so, leaving our investigation efforts at a standstill. Mandating only a \"reasonable\" investigation without further clarification seems like deferring the issue to the courts to define after extensive litigation. I believe starting with at least a general definition that includes obtaining documentation to support the claim that the consumer owes the debt/amount/and creditor is a sensible approach. I would appreciate seeing consumers utilize a form letter developed by the CFPB that outlines various disputes and aids them in clearly articulating their issues. I do think one of the most challenging aspects for a collector (and a major grievance from those subjected to collection efforts) is when they encounter someone claiming the debt belongs to another person with the same name. We conduct thorough investigations on our end (we attempt to match the last four digits of the social security number, may perform a skip trace to verify if the contacted individual resided at the address listed on the statements, etc. and we provide verification, yet in today's mobile world, confirming that the John Smith we've contacted is indeed the same John Smith associated with the debt can be quite tricky. This is particularly problematic if there is never any indication that we've reached the wrong individual. We certainly do not intend to contact the incorrect party regarding a debt, but this does, unfortunately, occur because consumers do not always update their contact information with creditors, forcing collectors to rely on the best available data.

{"id": "id_1474", "input": "Debt collectors initiate a significant number of default judgments primarily because consumers often fail to respond, not due to a lack of awareness about the situation. Typically, when a lawsuit is initiated, the debt collector has already tried to resolve the matter through phone calls and/or letters. This doesn't even account for the attempts the original creditor might have made. Filing a lawsuit is never the initial step taken. It generally occurs after numerous unsuccessful attempts to collaborate with a consumer to settle a pending debt. A default judgment is simply an extension of these efforts. Even post-lawsuit filing, efforts might be made to reach the consumer to resolve the issue before any judgment is rendered. I've encountered many cases where we've informed consumers that they can submit a response, yet they still choose not to. In my view, default judgments are mostly due to consumers' intentional disengagement from the process, rather than any misleading actions by the collector. I would mention that many states have local regulations stating if a consumer doesn't respond to a summons and defaults, they aren't required to be notified about a default judgment motion. Thus, the actual issuance of the judgment might indeed be unexpected, despite the summons indicating that a judgment could be made if unanswered. Nevertheless, an attorney adhering to local regulations is not being deceptive. To mitigate this unexpectedness for non-responding consumers, it might be beneficial to mandate that all motions for judgment be served to the consumer, regardless of local rules that might say otherwise. I should note, many motions for default judgments aren't scheduled for a motion hour. They might just be submitted for a decision without a court hearing. Regarding what is needed to justify a default judgment, this requirement varies from one court or judge to another. The courts I have observed that require more documentation typically look for affidavits of debt, charge-off statements, statements showing payments or charges, and the assignment (if the plaintiff is a debt buyer).", "topic": null, "demo_id": "00686", "framework": "cdcp", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 0, "to": 66}], "label": "fact", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 67, "to": 169}], "label": "value", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 170, "to": 304}], "label": "value", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 305, "to": 386}], "label": "value", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 387, "to": 436}], "label": "fact", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 437, "to": 550}], "label": "value", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 551, "to": 610}], "label": "value", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 611, "to": 734}], "label": "value", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 735, "to": 856}], "label": "testimony", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 857, "to": 1012}], "label": "value", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1013, "to": 1202}], "label": "value", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1203, "to": 1348}], "label": "value", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1349, "to": 1428}], "label": "value", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1429, "to": 1633}], "label": "value", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1634, "to": 1719}], "label": "value", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1720, "to": 1788}], "label": "value", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1789, "to": 1904}], "label": "fact", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1905, "to": 2120}], "label": "testimony", "id": 17}], "edges": [{"source": 0, "target": 1, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 4, "target": 5, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 11, "target": 10, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 14, "target": 15, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 16, "target": 17, "label": "CDCP_evidence"}], "tops": [0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16]}

At present, when you contest a debt, the collector informs the CRAs and this adversely affects your credit rating; in essence, the harm is done by then. Simply put, the note on the credit report indicating that the consumer disputes the debt is mostly disregarded by potential lenders, employers, landlords, and others. Therefore, disputing the debt does little to shield the consumer from damage. Debt collectors and creditors use the threat of reporting to CRAs as a tool to pressure you into paying a debt even if you genuinely do not owe the debt or the amount claimed. Regarding my suggestion, I don't anticipate an increase in litigation. Quite the contrary. If a consumer doesn't dispute the debt in a timely manner, then the debt can be considered verified or substantiated. However, if the debt is disputed on time, creditors and debt collectors will need to consider whether to proceed with litigation and assess the chances of success in court, which might lead them to be more selective about which debts to pursue legally. This proposal would also safeguard consumers from having their credit standing affected negatively until it is definitively shown that a disputed debt is indeed owed and the exact amount is established. As an alternative to my main proposal, a rule could be implemented that imposes substantial statutory penalties, triple damages, and the recovery of attorney's fees against creditors, debt collectors, and CRAs if the consumer can demonstrate that the disputed debt doesn't exist or is less than claimed. However, this method places the onus of proof on the consumer and I firmly believe that it should be the responsibility of creditors and debt collectors to actively demonstrate the existence and amount of any disputed debt before negatively affecting a consumer's credit report.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "01110", "framework": "cdcp", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 0, "to": 341}], "label": "policy", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 342, "to": 409}], "label": "fact", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 410, "to": 494}], "label": "fact", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 495, "to": 661}], "label": "value", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 662, "to": 739}], "label": "value", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 740, "to": 850}], "label": "value", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 851, "to": 915}], "label": "value", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 916, "to": 1006}], "label": "value", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1007, "to": 1124}], "label": "value", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1125, "to": 1377}], "label": "value", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1378, "to": 1580}], "label": "value", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1581, "to": 1884}], "label": "value", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1885, "to": 1946}], "label": "value", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1947, "to": 2163}], "label": "policy", "id": 13}], "edges": [{"source": 0, "target": 7, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 0, "target": 8, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 0, "target": 9, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 4, "target": 1, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 7, "target": 9, "label": "CDCP_reason"}], "tops": [0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13]}

{"id": "id_1525", "input": "In response to the initial inquiry, conducting thorough research is essential. Although collectors may continue pursuing legal actions, which I anticipate will persist, there should be repercussions for collectors if they make false claims. Should litigation be initiated against an incorrect individual, the initiating party must compensate the victim with a fair fee and pay a significant additional fee to the regulatory body to cover oversight expenses. Regarding the second inquiry, I am convinced that a vast majority of consumer debt is repayable. Nonetheless, exceptions to this are inevitable. For debts that cannot be retrieved for any reason, they should be definitively written off as non-recoverable and prohibited from being resold as collectible debt. The refinement and definition of 'Non-Collectable' must be determined by the relevant oversight bureau or agency. Addressing the third inquiry, both parties should be assessed. Currently, credit reporting agencies exist to oversee the consumer aspect of this matter, and a numerical evaluation score could be appended to the consumer's already existing credit report. This would serve as a foundational step that could be expanded as the system is refined. Conversely, the collector would necessitate a novel evaluation system that rates not just the organization overall, but also the individuals engaged in debt resolution activities. For effective illustrations of such systems, I would refer you to the Department of Transportation's Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and their Compliance-Safety-Accountability framework. Their system, admittedly, is considerably more intricate and delves deeper than what the debt industry would require. However, their scoring system is adaptable and robust for future modifications. It would also facilitate the evaluation of the original creditor. Such evaluation would provide the government and investors with better insight into the risk profile of a particular business. Incorporating Mr. Bartmann's suggestions, we create a framework where collectors and financial institutions self-regulate to ensure ethical and responsible outcomes, avoiding the defense of merely acting within legal boundaries. This would be advantageous for both parties and aid many consumers in escaping the cycle of overwhelming debt.

There should be more resources available for pro se litigants who can't afford private lawyers. (which constitutes 95% of the litigants in my city). In my experience, many individuals fail to respond to summonses because they weren't properly served, simply don't care, or, more commonly, can't comprehend the legal jargon. However, I frequently receive calls from litigants seeking guidance on their next steps after being served. When answers are submitted, they are usually in letter form rather than a \"legal\" verified response. Debt collection lawyers typically seize this opportunity to request a summary judgment. Our Court does not reject these letters, and we forward a copy to the attorney, arranging a pre-trial conference with a judge or court attorney to facilitate resolution between the parties. The Court must follow a scheduling protocol for these meetings, yet we maintain flexibility and strive to accommodate defendants facing scheduling conflicts as much as possible. When summonses are submitted, half contain exhaustive debt information, while others only list the amount owed. I observe that it can be challenging for litigants to secure additional evidence from attorneys, despite court orders.

Credit cards represent the most lucrative profit-making operation in the U.S., surpassing even the mortgage sector.

Whether these duplicate entries arise from negligence, incompetence, or intentional actions by the creditor or collector is not significant because it's the duty of the credit reporting agency to prevent this practice.

Automated dialing systems have various applications beyond debt collection: telemarketers use them to contact potential buyers, and schools employ them to inform parents about closures due to adverse weather conditions. The technology remains identical though the purpose varies depending on the user. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) bans creditors from using automated dialing systems to call cell phone numbers without the customer's permission. The TCPA's initial goal of shielding consumers from expensive automated call charges has evolved to focus on preventing excessive call attempts to a number often directly linked to the customer. This does not alter the objective of collection calls, it merely reduces the process's efficiency. Regulating which numbers can be dialed automatically conflicts with the increasing trend of households relying solely on wireless services. The Center for Disease Control's 'Wireless Substitution' recent report (Early release data, July-December 2012) indicates that over one-third (36%) of adults in the U.S. reside in households with only wireless phone service, a figure that climbs to 45% for children. With an annual growth rate averaging 34%, it is plausible that by 2020, only a minority of adults in the country will live in homes with a landline eligible for autodialing.

{"id": "id_1676", "input": "Arguably, the most outrageous event related to credit card debt transpired in 2002, alarmingly close to the aftermath of September 11th. During this time, insurance companies were disbursing tens of millions of dollars to building owners who sustained damage due to 9/11 (an action they technically should not have taken because it was considered an act of war, which is NOT typically covered under most insurance policies), the comptroller of the currency was preventing insurance companies from entering the market to compete with credit card companies in the field of credit card debt suspension insurance. This resulted in a monopoly for credit card companies in the debt suspension insurance market, with premiums inflated by 1000% to 2000%. The credit card companies' profit margins were so substantial that the CFPB had to impose fines exceeding 500 million dollars in the summer of 2012 due to aggressive sales and marketing tactics for credit card debt suspension insurance. I had already cautioned against the overpriced credit card debt suspension insurance back in 2008 through the creation of __URL__ yet I never received any compensation for my efforts. This scenario meant that the majority of credit card defaults in the United States over the past decade or so were rooted in the fraudulent overpricing of credit card debt suspension insurance that consumers found unaffordable. Consumers ended up paying for five years' worth of credit card debt suspension insurance but only got coverage for three to five months! Judges often supported the inflated pricing of a monopolistic credit card debt suspension insurance policy, which failed to offer consumers a fair way to shield themselves from defaults triggered by life-altering events. We could essentially revitalize the U.S. economy almost instantly by taking the right steps. Initially, acknowledge the credit card debt suspension insurance fraud that credit card companies have imposed on Americans over the past 10 to 15 years. As compensation, reduce all consumer credit card debt by about 65%. Subsequently, increase the monthly minimum payment on the remaining 35% from 2% to 5%. This way, the monthly payment remains approximately the same, but consumers will find it easier to manage their debt moving forward.

{"id": "id_1724", "input": "In my opinion, the primary issue stems from the financial institutions operating two systems that are not fully synchronized. One of these is the system of record, which maintains detailed account information. The other is a charge-off system, used to monitor activities following the account's charge-off. Events occurring within the charge-off system typically aren't communicated to the system of record. Moreover, the charge-off system is either not utilized or excluded from credit reporting. Another issue arises from mergers or acquisitions, where only the system of record is integrated, leaving behind the acquired charge-off system. This results in a gap concerning the specific status after an account has been charged off. When accounts are outsourced or sold, the information dependence lies solely on the system of record, excluding the charge-off system. A third complication involves consumers holding multiple accounts with the original lender, increasing the likelihood of different accounts being handled by separate agencies or debt buyers. Even if debt buyers and collectors gain access, the events that transpired on the account are generally not documented in the system of record, and the charge-off system might be phased out. The matter of credit reporting disputes hinges on whether an agency or debt buyer provides information to a credit reporting bureau.

{"id": "id_1755", "input": "This proposal is an excellent initiative. Currently, debt purchasers acquire debt at an average rate of 4 cents per dollar. Numerous debts are purchased at rates between 2 and 4 cents per dollar. Additionally, several other debts are transferred without any cost. As an initial creditor, I would aim to maximize the return from a debt owed to me. Therefore, if I could secure 10 cents per dollar directly from the debtor instead of 4 cents from a debt purchaser, I would be inclined to offer a considerably reduced settlement rate to the debtor (or as you describe, allowing consumers to bid on their own debt). At present, original creditors do not offer a significantly reduced rate to debtors before selling the debt for 4 cents per dollar. The majority of creditors scarcely provide debtors with a 10% discount as a settlement offer. Admittedly, a creditor might swiftly unload portfolios to debt purchasers by selling at 4 cents per dollar. However, creditors could potentially earn substantially more by presenting a one-time offer of 10 cents per dollar (or a similarly appealing amount that exceeds 4 cents per dollar). It might be beneficial for the CFPB to implement a regulation granting consumers/debtors a limited-time opportunity to receive a one-time offer, valid for a specific number of days (perhaps 45 days) from the receipt date of the letter from their creditors, featuring a markedly reduced rate. This offer would be available for a brief duration and would notify consumers that if they do not accept, the creditor will then transfer the debt to a purchaser. Such a letter would only be dispatched if the creditor intends to sell the debt, rather than as another collection attempt. This approach grants consumers one last chance to settle their owed debts while creditors experience reduced losses and increased profits, enabling them to offer more loans to consumers, provide better rates, and boost economic activity. When money circulates at higher values (10 cents per dollar versus 4 cents per dollar), rather than being stagnant in accounts receivable awaiting collection (eventually, if at all), it invigorates the economy. Implementing this rule would solely generate positive outcomes for everyone involved, without any negative repercussions. There might be a slight effect on the debt collection sector, as they could acquire fewer debts in their portfolios, but this minor effect is compensated by the substantial positive impacts on the economic landscape.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "01144", "framework": "cdcp", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 0, "to": 41}], "label": "value", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 42, "to": 123}], "label": "fact", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 124, "to": 195}], "label": "fact", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 196, "to": 263}], "label": "fact", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 264, "to": 346}], "label": "value", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 347, "to": 611}], "label": "value", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 612, "to": 743}], "label": "fact", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 744, "to": 837}], "label": "fact", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 838, "to": 945}], "label": "value", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 946, "to": 1127}], "label": "value", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1128, "to": 1419}], "label": "policy", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1420, "to": 1582}], "label": "policy", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1583, "to": 1706}], "label": "policy", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1707, "to": 1780}], "label": "value", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1781, "to": 1944}], "label": "value", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1945, "to": 2155}], "label": "value", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2156, "to": 2277}], "label": "value", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2278, "to": 2394}], "label": "value", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2395, "to": 2494}], "label": "value", "id": 18}], "edges": [{"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 12, "target": 14, "label": "CDCP_reason"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18]}

The essence of involuntary default is the occurrence of an uncontrollable event that hinders an individual's ability to meet their monthly financial obligations. Involuntary default indicates that the defaulter commits to repaying only the amount owed at the time of default, with no additional charges. I propose that the principle of a \"promise to pay\" constitutes a constitutional breach of cruel and unusual punishment.

Warning: The commitment to pay your credit card bill every month takes precedence over any natural disaster or personal crisis that might arise in your life.

{"id": "id_1827", "input": "I'm currently enduring a terrible ordeal with a creditor and debt collection agency. In 2004, I graduated from college and consolidated all my student loans through Nelnet. Around 2005, I began receiving calls from debt collectors claiming I was behind on my loan payments. I clarified that I consistently made my payments on time through Nelnet and requested proof of the debt before making any further payments. No evidence of the debt was ever provided to me. This conversation repeated itself multiple times over the next five years. In 2011, I was eager to purchase my (wife's) dream home. It was a major financial decision. The bankers informed me that resolving the student loan issue was necessary for loan approval. I contacted both the original creditor and the debt collector, pleading for evidence of the loan. They provided only a loan application, with no indication of approval or any funds being disbursed to me. Despite feeling uneasy about the provided proof, I realized that pursuing legal action would take more time than I was willing to invest. I was meticulous in my discussions with the original creditor and debt collector to ensure the matter would be resolved on my credit report if I paid the full amount of the (alleged) loan. I recorded all my conversations with the original creditor and the debt collector. I settled the original loan amount. Predictably, the original creditor refused to amend my credit report. Even after I presented evidence to the credit reporting agencies that the debt was settled, they too declined to update my credit report. To complicate matters further, after I paid the debt, I received a notice from the debt collector stating that several thousand dollars had been waived. I promptly reached out to the debt collector for documentation supporting their claimed amount, including any agreement on a specific interest rate, but received no response. Now, I am in a dispute with the IRS over any potential additional taxes. Even though I cleared the debt two years ago, my credit report remains unchanged. It's utterly absurd that any business can wield such power to severely affect an individual without proper documentation. Creditors should be mandated to provide specific documentation before issuing negative credit reports, and there should be severe penalties for creditors or debt collectors pursuing debts without the necessary documentation.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "01267", "framework": "cdcp", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 0, "to": 84}], "label": "value", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 85, "to": 172}], "label": "testimony", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 173, "to": 273}], "label": "testimony", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 274, "to": 413}], "label": "testimony", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 414, "to": 462}], "label": "testimony", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 463, "to": 537}], "label": "testimony", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 538, "to": 594}], "label": "value", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 595, "to": 629}], "label": "value", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 630, "to": 724}], "label": "testimony", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 725, "to": 822}], "label": "testimony", "id": 9}, {"anchors": [{"from": 823, "to": 928}], "label": "testimony", "id": 10}, {"anchors": [{"from": 929, "to": 977}], "label": "value", "id": 11}, {"anchors": [{"from": 978, "to": 1066}], "label": "value", "id": 12}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1067, "to": 1255}], "label": "value", "id": 13}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1256, "to": 1338}], "label": "testimony", "id": 14}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1339, "to": 1374}], "label": "testimony", "id": 15}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1375, "to": 1444}], "label": "testimony", "id": 16}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1445, "to": 1582}], "label": "testimony", "id": 17}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1583, "to": 1735}], "label": "testimony", "id": 18}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1736, "to": 1910}], "label": "testimony", "id": 19}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1911, "to": 1983}], "label": "testimony", "id": 20}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1984, "to": 2065}], "label": "testimony", "id": 21}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2066, "to": 2187}], "label": "value", "id": 22}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2188, "to": 2412}], "label": "policy", "id": 23}], "edges": [{"source": 13, "target": 12, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 20, "target": 19, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 23, "target": 22, "label": "CDCP_reason"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 23]}

Such a situation results in an unequal power dynamic that hinders effective communication.

A national SOL serves the interests of debt collectors rather than those of the consumers. Efforts should concentrate on crafting a solution that, to the greatest extent possible, benefits both debt collectors and consumers. Implementing a national SOL of 7 years, as ACA International advocates, undermines state laws, where some states have an SOL of 3 years or less. The purpose of an SOL is to provide resolution. In reality, if a debt collector or owner fails to settle issues within the current state-specific SOL, extending or nationalizing the SOL only enables ongoing harassment of consumers. Three years is indeed sufficient time to initiate a lawsuit.

{"id": "id_1906", "input": "I concur that this concerns Financial Literacy, Yet, it also involves the courts upholding entirely biased credit card adhesion contracts that offer no rights to the debtor or defaulter, even under the most humane circumstances, thereby questioning the legality of these one-sided agreements. Let's recall that it was the comptroller of the currency in 2002 who blocked the Insurance industry from competing in the credit card debt suspension insurance market alongside credit card companies. This decision allowed credit card companies to maintain an outrageous monopoly on expensive credit card debt suspension insurance premiums charged to their customers, who could have otherwise had policies to temporarily halt interest rate charges during life-altering emergencies. Financial literacy is relevant when considering the 2% monthly minimum payment scheme targeting first-time credit card users. These 2% monthly minimum payments are akin to a drug dealer giving free samples to hook individuals on their product. Someone can purchase a $1,000 high-quality television set and only need to pay $20 or $25 the following month. To me, that amounts to credit card addiction. Financial Literacy might involve having a cautionary message printed in bold on every credit card agreement, alerting consumers to the strategic low monthly minimum payments designed to increase debt, the lack of empathy for significant life events, and the excessive pricing of credit card debt suspension insurance, sometimes marked up by as much as 2,000%. Include these three warnings on every agreement in bold letters, and two outcomes arise, customers stand a better chance of achieving financial literacy, and it signifies an acknowledgment of deceit by credit card companies regarding all previous agreements. Thus, the irony is credit card companies cannot change even if they desired to. But where will the external pressure originate to enforce these obvious credit card warnings?

I didn't respond to the robo-calls; when I did answer, there was no one on the line, and no messages were ever left behind. The caller ID was blocked as \"1 Unavailable,\" a tactic used to bypass call-blocking systems on the recipient's phone, making it impossible to trace the caller through reverse lookups and similar methods. On one occasion, I answered and finally, there was someone on the line, allowing me to identify who was calling, even though they were extremely hesitant to reveal their identity. I then researched them online and managed to obtain their phone number. I repeatedly informed them that I was not the individual they were searching for, yet they persisted in calling. Eventually, I sought legal assistance and after months of my attorney negotiating with them, I received a small financial settlement. This ordeal took place while I was undergoing chemotherapy for cancer and was extremely unwell. These practices turned my life into a nightmare for several months. Collectors should be forbidden from hiding their identities or the numbers they use to call back. This situation occurred because I had recently moved and received a new number, which apparently had been assigned to several people with unpaid debts. I was apprehensive about changing my number again as it would likely attract a new set of collectors. There should be significantly more severe financial penalties for such violations. The entity responsible in this case was a national collection agency with substantial annual revenue; the meager amount I eventually received was for them just a minuscule fraction of a cent compared to their yearly earnings. Being an attorney myself, I checked their name on Pacer-- they had been sued repeatedly in both state and federal courts and had even paid million-dollar fines to state attorneys general--all of which were just minor expenses for them in light of their vast annual revenues.
