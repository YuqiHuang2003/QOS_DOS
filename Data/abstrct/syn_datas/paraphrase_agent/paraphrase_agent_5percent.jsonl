{"id": "id_0", "input": "Cancer treatment often leads to diminished quality of life (QOL) for patients, prompting various strategies to tackle these issues. This project investigated the QOL differences between older adults (age 65+) and younger adults (age 18-64) with advanced cancer, in response to a comprehensive intervention aimed at enhancing QOL. The study's registration is on ClinicalTrials.gov. Patients newly diagnosed with advanced cancer and receiving radiation therapy were randomly assigned to either an active QOL intervention group or a control group. Participants in the intervention group underwent six 90-minute multidisciplinary sessions addressing the five key areas of QOL. Evaluations at baseline and during weeks 4, 27, and 52 included QOL assessments (Linear Analogue Self-Assessment (LASA), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G)) and mood evaluations (Profile of Mood States (POMS)). The Kruskall-Wallis method was utilized to compare the scores of older and younger adults in the intervention group. Among the 131 patients in the broader randomized controlled trial, data from 54 evaluable participants (16 older adults and 38 younger adults) in the intervention group were analyzed. Older adult patients reported higher overall QOL (LASA 74.4 vs. 62.9, p = 0.040), greater social well-being (FACT-G 91.1 vs. 83.3, p = 0.045), and experienced fewer anger-related issues (POMS anger-hostility 95.0 vs. 86.4, p = 0.028). Sustained improvements for older patients were evident in the anger-hostility scores at week 27 (92.2 vs. 84.2, p = 0.027) and week 52 (96.3 vs. 85.9, p = 0.005). Older adults receiving a multidisciplinary intervention to boost QOL during advanced cancer treatment experienced unique benefits in certain QOL areas compared to their younger counterparts.

{"id": "id_1", "input": "In the treatment of ovarian carcinoma, the combination of a platinum-based agent and a taxane, such as paclitaxel, is widely recognized as the standard approach. This study evaluated the efficacy of docetaxel-carboplatin compared to paclitaxel-carboplatin as an initial chemotherapy regimen for patients with stage Ic-IV epithelial ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer. A total of 1077 patients were randomly assigned to receive either docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m2 via a 1-hour intravenous infusion or paclitaxel at 175 mg/m2 through a 3-hour intravenous infusion. Each treatment was followed by carboplatin to reach an area under the plasma concentration-time curve of 5. The chemotherapy cycles were repeated every 3 weeks for a total of six cycles, with the option of an additional three cycles of carboplatin alone for those responding to the treatment. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves, and hazard ratios were calculated using the Cox proportional hazards model. All statistical analyses were conducted with two-sided tests. After a median follow-up period of 23 months, both treatment groups showed comparable progression-free survival rates, with median durations of 15.0 months for the docetaxel-carboplatin group and 14.8 months for the paclitaxel-carboplatin group. The hazard ratio for docetaxel versus paclitaxel was 0.97, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 0.83 to 1.13, and the P-value was .707. Similarly, the overall survival rates at 2 years were 64.2% and 68.9%, respectively, with a hazard ratio of 1.13 and a 95% confidence interval from 0.92 to 1.39, yielding a P-value of .238. Objective tumor response rates were 58.7% and 59.5%, with a difference of -0.8% (95% CI = -8.6% to 7.1%; P = .868), and CA-125 response rates were 75.8% and 76.8%, with a difference of -1.0% (95% CI = -7.2% to 5.1%; P = .794). Nevertheless, the docetaxel-carboplatin regimen was linked to markedly lower levels of overall and grade 2 or higher neurotoxicity when compared to paclitaxel-carboplatin. Specifically, grade 2 or higher neurosensory toxicity occurred in 11% of the docetaxel group versus 30% of the paclitaxel group, showing a difference of 19% with a 95% confidence interval between 15% and 24% (P<.001). Similarly, grade 2 or higher neuromotor toxicity was observed in 3% of the docetaxel group compared to 7% in the paclitaxel group, reflecting a difference of 4% with a 95% confidence interval from 1% to 7% (P<.001). On the contrary, treatment with docetaxel-carboplatin resulted in a statistically significant increase in the incidence of grade 3-4 neutropenia, occurring in 94% of patients compared to 84% in the paclitaxel-carboplatin group, with a difference of 11% and a 95% confidence interval ranging from 7% to 14% (P<.001), as well as more neutropenic complications. However, despite the increase in myelosuppression, it did not have any adverse effects on dose delivery or the safety of the patients. Overall, the global quality of life remained similar across both treatment arms. However, there were significant improvements in many symptom scores that favored the docetaxel regimen. In terms of progression-free survival and response, the docetaxel-carboplatin combination seems to be on par with the paclitaxel-carboplatin regimen, although a longer period of follow-up is necessary to make a conclusive statement regarding survival. Therefore, docetaxel-carboplatin offers an alternative initial chemotherapy option for patients newly diagnosed with ovarian cancer.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "15547181", "framework": "abstrct", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 1058, "to": 1863}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1864, "to": 2469}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2470, "to": 2828}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2829, "to": 2963}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2964, "to": 3044}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 3045, "to": 3148}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 3149, "to": 3298}], "label": "Claim", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 3299, "to": 3400}], "label": "Claim", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 3401, "to": 3533}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 8}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "AbstRCT_Partial-Attack"}, {"source": 4, "target": 5, "label": "AbstRCT_Partial-Attack"}, {"source": 5, "target": 1, "label": "AbstRCT_Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 0, "label": "AbstRCT_Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "AbstRCT_Partial-Attack"}, {"source": 8, "target": 6, "label": "AbstRCT_Support"}], "tops": [2, 4, 8]}

Additionally, it sought to preliminarily compare these experimental treatments against a biweekly schedule of LFA-5-FU modulated by methotrexate (MTX + LFA-5-FU). A total of 159 patients suffering from advanced colorectal cancer, who had not previously been treated for metastatic disease (with 34 having undergone adjuvant 5-FU treatment), were randomly assigned to the following groups: Group A received CPT-11, 200 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1, followed by LFA, 250 mg/m2 intravenously as an infusion and 5-FU, 850 mg/m2 intravenously as a bolus on day 2; Group B was given TOM, 3 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1, followed by LFA, 250 mg/m2 intravenously as an infusion and 5-FU, 1050 mg/m2 intravenously as a bolus on day 2; Group C received MTX, 750 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1, followed by LFA, 250 mg/m2 intravenously as an infusion and 5-FU, 800 mg/m2 intravenously as a bolus on day 2. Treatment cycles were administered every two weeks across all groups in the trial. Response rates (RR) were assessed after every four treatment cycles. The sample size was determined to achieve an 80% probability of detecting a 35% RR for each experimental therapy and to identify a minimum 4% difference in RR with standard treatment if the actual difference was at least 15%. The RRs were reported as follows: 34% (95% confidence interval (95%, CI): 21%-48%) for arm A, which included 3 complete responses (CRs) and 15 partial responses (PRs), 24% (95% CI: 14%-38%) for arm B, comprising 2 CRs and 11 PRs, and 24% (95% CI: 14%-38%) with 2 CRs and 11 PRs for arm C. After a median follow-up period of 62 weeks (range 18-108 weeks), the median progression time was 38 weeks for arm A, 25 weeks for arm B, and 27 weeks for arm C. With 94 patients remaining alive, the likelihood of survival at one year was 61% for arm A, 54% for arm B, and 59% for arm C. Severe neutropenia of WHO grade 3 or 4 affected 46% of patients, while 16% experienced diarrhea, in those treated with CPT-11 + LFA 5-FU. The median relative dose intensity across eight cycles (DI8) was 78% for CPT-11 and 82% for 5-FU. Severe toxicities observed with TOM + LFA-5-FU included neutropenia (16%) and diarrhea (16%), while the median relative DI8 was 93% for TOM and 82% for 5-FU. CPT-11 + LFA-5-FU demonstrates favorable comparisons in terms of efficacy and side effects against other combination regimens that involve CPT-11 and continuous infusion of 5-FU. Following this interim analysis, the possibility of a RR being 15% higher with the MTX + LFA-5-FU treatment cannot be dismissed.

No universally accepted method has been found that effectively diminishes its severity. Misoprostol, a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin E1, acts as a mucosal protector. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate misoprostol's efficacy in patients with head and neck cancer. The study's goal was to assess whether topical misoprostol could lessen the intensity of radiation-induced mucositis for those undergoing high-dose radiotherapy. Additionally, the impact of this treatment on patients' overall well-being was examined. The main focus of the study was to observe the occurrence of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 3 mucositis.

Additionally, 102 more patients, including 97 who opted for chemotherapy, were later added to the study based on personal treatment preferences, and data from these individuals served a confirmatory purpose. Those undergoing chemotherapy reported enhanced overall physical functioning and better symptom management compared to those receiving only supportive care. Differences between the groups were less pronounced in the psychosocial aspects, although there were positive trends leaning towards the chemotherapy group. There were no notable advantages observed for the supportive care group, with the exception of hair loss. The median survival was 29 weeks for those in the chemotherapy group compared to 11 weeks in the supportive care group, with 1-year survival rates being 28% versus 8%, respectively. Similar outcomes in terms of quality of life and survival were observed among both randomised and non-randomised chemotherapy patients. There were no fatalities linked to the treatment.

We assigned 122 lymphoma patients to either standard care (n = 62) or a 12-week regimen of supervised aerobic exercise training (AET; n = 60). Our main sleep outcome was overall sleep quality, measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Additional outcomes included the individual PSQI component scores.

In particular, AET enhanced overall sleep quality in lymphoma patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (P = 0.001), those undergoing chemotherapy (P = 0.013), diagnosed less than 2 years ago (P = 0.005), individuals classified as obese (P = 0.025), and those with poor baseline sleep quality (P = 0.007). AET did not yield a significant improvement in sleep quality across this varied group of lymphoma patients; nonetheless, certain identifiable subgroups seemed to gain benefits.

Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has demonstrated some preventative and healing benefits against objective clinical indicators of OM in a few studies, including our latest published research. However, there is a lack of evidence concerning the impact of LLLT on patients' subjective experiences of OM and QOL. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the effects of LLLT on patient-reported outcomes of OM and QOL in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients undergoing CRT. In this triple-blind study, 220 HNC patients scheduled for CRT (three weekly sessions of Cisplatin + radiotherapy = 66 Gray (2 Gy/session), five fractions per week for 6.5 weeks, totaling 33 fractions) were randomly assigned to either the laser group (110 patients) or the placebo group (110 patients).

Evaluating patient quality of life was also part of the study. Each BEP cycle consisted of etoposide at 500 mg/m(2), given either as 100 mg/m(2) over days 1 to 5 or 165 mg/m(2) over days 1 to 3, and cisplatin at 100 mg/m(2), administered at either 20 mg/m(2) over days 1 to 5 or 50 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 2.

The study involved 60 participants: 41 with resectable and 19 with unresectable pancreatic cancer. Quality of life was measured using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) questionnaire. Three primary quality of life scales (overall health status, functional, and symptom scales) were evaluated and contrasted between the two treatment groups. The evaluation of quality of life revealed a statistically significant decline in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer who received radiotherapy combined with gemcitabine. A similar reduction in quality of life was noted later in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer undergoing the same treatment regimen. The treatment involving radiotherapy and 5-fluorouracil only altered certain aspects of quality of life and did not significantly affect overall quality of life.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "17090981", "framework": "abstrct", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 151, "to": 228}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1206, "to": 1383}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1384, "to": 1525}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1526, "to": 1687}], "label": "Claim", "id": 3}], "edges": [{"source": 3, "target": 1, "label": "AbstRCT_Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 2, "label": "AbstRCT_Support"}], "tops": [0, 3]}

This research focused on analyzing the QOL disparities between senior adults (age 65+) and younger adults (age 18-64) with advanced cancer, in response to a comprehensive intervention aimed at boosting QOL. The study was officially registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. Individuals newly diagnosed with advanced cancer and receiving radiation therapy were randomly assigned to either an active QOL intervention group or a control group. Participants in the intervention group engaged in six 90-minute sessions conducted by a multidisciplinary team, targeting the five key domains of QOL. Assessments were carried out at the start and during weeks 4, 27, and 52, including QOL evaluations (using Linear Analogue Self-Assessment (LASA), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G)) and mood assessments (using Profile of Mood States (POMS)). The Kruskall-Wallis test was employed to compare scores between the older and younger adults subjected to the intervention. Out of 131 participants in the larger randomized controlled trial, data is presented from 54 evaluable patients (16 older adults and 38 younger adults) assigned to the intervention group. Senior patients demonstrated superior overall QOL (LASA 74.4 vs. 62.9, p = 0.040), enhanced social well-being (FACT-G 91.1 vs. 83.3, p = 0.045), and encountered fewer issues with anger (POMS anger-hostility 95.0 vs. 86.4, p = 0.028).

This study undertook a comparison between the regimen of docetaxel-carboplatin and paclitaxel-carboplatin as initial chemotherapy for patients with stage Ic-IV epithelial ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer. A total of 1077 participants were randomly allocated to receive either docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m2 (administered via a 1-hour intravenous infusion) or paclitaxel at a dose of 175 mg/m2 (administered via a 3-hour intravenous infusion). Following these treatments, carboplatin was given to achieve an area under the plasma concentration-time curve of 5. The treatment cycles were repeated every three weeks for six cycles, with the possibility of three additional cycles of carboplatin alone for patients who responded well. Survival analyses were conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the Cox proportional hazards model was employed to estimate hazard ratios. All statistical analyses were conducted using two-sided tests. Following a median observation period of 23 months, both treatment groups demonstrated comparable progression-free survival times (medians being 15.0 months for the docetaxel-carboplatin group and 14.8 months for the paclitaxel-carboplatin group; hazard ratio [HR] for docetaxel versus paclitaxel = 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.83 to 1.13; P = .707), similar overall survival rates at the two-year mark (64.2% and 68.9% respectively; HR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.92 to 1.39; P = .238), and parallel response rates in terms of objective tumor response (58.7% and 59.5%, respectively; difference of -0.8%, 95% CI = -8.6% to 7.1%; P = .868) and CA-125 levels (75.8% and 76.8%, respectively; difference = -1.0%, 95% CI = -7.2% to 5.1%; P = .794).

Additionally, it sought to preliminarily compare these experimental treatments with a biweekly dose of LFA-5-FU modulated by methotrexate (MTX + LFA-5-FU). A total of 159 patients with advanced colorectal cancer, who had not yet received treatment for metastatic disease (with 34 having prior exposure to adjuvant 5-FU), were randomly assigned to one of the following: CPT-11 at 200 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1, followed by LFA at 250 mg/m2 via intravenous infusion and 5-FU at 850 mg/m2 as an intravenous bolus on day 2 (arm A); TOM at 3 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1, followed by LFA at 250 mg/m2 via intravenous infusion and 5-FU at 1050 mg/m2 as an intravenous bolus on day 2 (arm B); or MTX at 750 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1, followed by LFA at 250 mg/m2 via intravenous infusion and 5-FU at 800 mg/m2 as an intravenous bolus on day 2 (arm C). All treatment arms were repeated every two weeks. Response rate (RR) was assessed after every four treatment cycles. The study's sample size was calculated to ensure an 80% probability of detecting a 35% RR with each experimental therapy and identifying a minimum of a 4% RR difference with the standard treatment, assuming a true difference of at least 15%. The RRs observed were: 34% (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 21%-48%) in arm A, with 3 complete responses (CRs) and 15 partial responses (PRs); 24% (95% CI: 14%-38%) in both arm B and arm C, each with 2 CRs and 11 PRs. Following a median follow-up duration of 62 weeks (ranging from 18 to 108 weeks), the median time until disease progression was noted as 38 weeks for arm A, 25 weeks for arm B, and 27 weeks for arm C. Among the 94 patients still living, the probability of surviving one year was 61% for arm A, 54% for arm B, and 59% for arm C. WHO grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and diarrhea were experienced by 46% and 16% of patients, respectively, who received the CPT-11 + LFA 5-FU treatment. The median relative dose intensity over eight cycles (DI8) was 78% for CPT-11 and 82% for 5-FU. Severe toxicities associated with the TOM + LFA-5-FU regimen included neutropenia and diarrhea, each affecting 16% of patients, while the median relative DI8 stood at 93% for TOM and 82% for 5-FU. The CPT-11 + LFA-5-FU regimen demonstrates a favorable balance of activity and toxicity when compared to other combination therapies involving CPT-11 and continuous infusion of 5-FU. This interim analysis does not eliminate the possibility that the RR could be 15% higher with the CPT-11 + LFA-5-FU treatment compared to the MTX + LFA-5-FU regimen.

We carried out a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the effectiveness of misoprostol in patients with head and neck cancer. The study aimed to assess if topical application of misoprostol could lessen the intensity of radiation-induced mucositis in patients receiving radical dose radiotherapy.

In a study involving 354 breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, participants were randomly divided into two equal groups to receive either epoetin alfa (40,000 U weekly) or standard care (SOC). Quality of life (QOL) metrics were evaluated at the start and at the 12-week mark. Hemoglobin levels, the necessity for transfusions, and factors predicting responses were also analyzed. By the end of 12 weeks, the change scores for the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An; mean change, 2.16 +/- 12.84 for epoetin alfa compared to -4.43 +/- 13.42 for SOC) and FACT-An fatigue (mean change, 1.85 +/- 10.52 for epoetin alfa versus -3.55 +/- 11.14 for SOC) were notably higher in the epoetin alfa group (P < .0001). Significantly more patients in the epoetin alfa group achieved hemoglobin responses, defined as a mean hemoglobin level of \u226512 g/dL or an increase of \u22652 g/dL from baseline, compared to those in the SOC group: 52.0% versus 5.1% and 65.7% versus 6.3%, respectively (P < .0001 for both metrics).

Conducted as a controlled multicenter trial, participants were randomly assigned to receive either supportive care alone or supportive care along with chemotherapy. The chemotherapy regimen included intravenous carboplatin at a dosage of 300 mg/m2 on the first day and oral etoposide at 120 mg/m2 from days 1 to 5, repeated every four weeks for up to eight cycles. Quality of life assessments were carried out at the time of randomisation, before each treatment cycle, and at similar four-week intervals for the control group, utilizing the EORTC QLQ-C30 + LC13 questionnaire. A total of 48 patients were randomly divided (26 receiving supportive care, 22 undergoing chemotherapy) and were eligible for comparative analysis. Additionally, 102 patients, 97 of whom chose chemotherapy, were later added based on individual treatment preferences, with their data used for confirmation purposes. Patients undergoing chemotherapy showed improved overall physical health and better management of symptoms compared to those receiving only supportive care. Differences between the groups were less pronounced in terms of psychosocial aspects, though there was a trend favoring the chemotherapy group. No substantial advantages were observed for the supportive care group, aside from increased occurrences of hair loss. Median survival was 29 weeks for the chemotherapy group in contrast to 11 weeks for those with supportive care, with 1-year survival rates being 28% versus 8%. Quality of life and survival outcomes remained consistent across both randomised and non-randomised patients who received chemotherapy. No fatalities linked to the treatment occurred.

Yet, until now, no research has specifically explored this possibility. We assigned 122 lymphoma patients to either a standard care group (n = 62) or a group undergoing 12 weeks of guided aerobic exercise training (AET; n = 60). Our main measure for sleep was overall sleep quality, evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), while secondary measures included PSQI component scores. We also carried out preplanned subgroup analyses. Intention-to-treat analyses demonstrated that AET led to a non-significant enhancement (P = 0.16) in overall sleep quality when compared to standard care [mean group difference = -0.64; 95% confidence interval (CI), -1.56 to +0.27].

More precisely, AET enhanced overall sleep quality in lymphoma patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (P = 0.001), those undergoing chemotherapy (P = 0.013), patients diagnosed less than 2 years ago (P = 0.005), those with obesity (P = 0.025), and individuals who were poor sleepers at the outset (P = 0.007). AET did not lead to a significant improvement in sleep quality across this diverse group of lymphoma patients; however, certain clearly distinguishable subgroups seemed to gain benefits.

Some trials, including our recent publication, have demonstrated that low-level laser therapy (LLLT) offers both preventive and therapeutic benefits against objectively measured OM. However, there is limited evidence about LLLT's impact on patients' subjective experiences of OM and their QOL. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess how LLLT affects patients' self-reported OM and QOL outcomes in individuals with head and neck cancer (HNC) undergoing CRT. This triple-blind study involved 220 HNC patients scheduled for CRT (administering Cisplatin weekly along with RT, amounting to 66 Gray at 2 Gy per session, spread over five sessions a week for 6.5 weeks, totaling 33 sessions) who were randomly assigned into laser (110 patients) and placebo (110 patients) groups.

Additionally, patient quality of life was evaluated. Each cycle of BEP included etoposide at a dosage of 500 mg/m(2), given either 100 mg/m(2) from days 1 to 5 or 165 mg/m(2) from days 1 to 3, cisplatin at 100 mg/m(2), delivered either at 20 mg/m(2) from days 1 to 5 or 50 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 2.

In our study, we compared the efficacy of docetaxel-carboplatin against paclitaxel-carboplatin as initial chemotherapy for patients with stage Ic-IV epithelial ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer. A total of 1077 patients were randomly allocated to receive either docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 via a one-hour intravenous infusion or paclitaxel at 175 mg/m2 through a three-hour intravenous infusion. Following these treatments, carboplatin was administered to reach an area under the plasma concentration-time curve of 5. The treatment cycles were repeated every three weeks for a total of six cycles, with the option for patients who responded to have three additional cycles of carboplatin alone. Survival outcomes were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and hazard ratios were determined using the Cox proportional hazards model. All statistical evaluations were conducted with two-sided tests. After a median follow-up period of 23 months, progression-free survival was comparable between both groups (median of 15.0 months for docetaxel-carboplatin and 14.8 months for paclitaxel-carboplatin; hazard ratio [HR] for docetaxel versus paclitaxel = 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.83 to 1.13; P = .707), as were the overall survival rates at the two-year mark (64.2% and 68.9%, respectively; HR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.92 to 1.39; P = .238), along with the objective tumor (58.7% and 59.5%, respectively; difference between docetaxel and paclitaxel = -0.8%, 95% CI = -8.6% to 7.1%; P = .868) and CA-125 response rates (75.8% and 76.8%, respectively; difference docetaxel-paclitaxel = -1.0%, 95% CI = -7.2% to 5.1%; P = .794). Nevertheless, the incidence of overall and grade 2 or higher neurotoxicity was notably lower with docetaxel-carboplatin compared to paclitaxel-carboplatin (grade \u22652 neurosensory toxicity in 11% versus 30%, difference = 19%, 95% CI = 15% to 24%; P<.001; grade \u22652 neuromotor toxicity in 3% versus 7%, difference = 4%, 95% CI = 1% to 7%; P<.001).

However, the occurrence of myelosuppression did not affect the delivery of the dose or compromise patient safety. Overall, the global quality of life remained consistent across both treatment groups, although there were significant differences in various symptom scores that were more favorable for docetaxel. Docetaxel-carboplatin seems to be comparable to paclitaxel-carboplatin in terms of progression-free survival and treatment response, but a longer observation period is necessary to make a conclusive judgment on survival outcomes.

A preliminary comparison was also made between these experimental regimens and a biweekly schedule of LFA-5-FU enhanced by methotrexate (MTX + LFA-5-FU). The study involved 159 patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma who had not previously received treatment for metastatic disease, though 34 had prior exposure to adjuvant 5-FU. Participants were randomly assigned to receive one of the following: CPT-11, 200 mg/m2 intravenously on the first day, followed by LFA, 250 mg/m2, and 5-FU, 850 mg/m2 intravenously on the second day (arm A); TOM, 3 mg/m2 intravenously on the first day, followed by LFA, 250 mg/m2, and 5-FU, 1050 mg/m2 intravenously on the second day (arm B); or MTX, 750 mg/m2 intravenously on the first day, followed by LFA, 250 mg/m2, and 5-FU, 800 mg/m2 intravenously on the second day (arm C). All treatment cycles were repeated every two weeks. The response rate (RR) was assessed after every four treatment courses. The sample size was calculated to ensure an 80% chance of detecting a 35% RR for each experimental treatment and to identify a minimum 4% difference in RR compared to the standard treatment if the true difference is 15% or more. The observed RRs were: 34% (95% confidence interval: 21%-48%) for arm A, comprising 3 complete responses (CRs) and 15 partial responses (PRs); 24% (95% CI: 14%-38%) for arm B, comprising 2 CRs and 11 PRs; and 24% (95% CI: 14%-38%), comprising 2 CRs and 11 PRs, for arm C. Following a median observation period of 62 weeks (range 18-108 weeks), the median duration before disease progression was 38 weeks for arm A, 25 weeks for arm B, and 27 weeks for arm C. With 94 patients still surviving, the probability of living for one year was 61%, 54%, and 59% for arms A, B, and C, respectively. WHO grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and diarrhea were observed in 46% and 16% of patients, respectively, who received CPT-11 + LFA 5-FU. Over eight cycles, the median relative dose intensity was calculated to be 78% for CPT-11 and 82% for 5-FU. Severe side effects in the TOM + LFA-5-FU group included neutropenia (16%) and diarrhea (16%), while the median relative dose intensity over eight cycles was 93% for TOM and 82% for 5-FU. The CPT-11 + LFA-5-FU regimen shows favorable results in terms of effectiveness and side effects when compared to other combination treatments involving CPT-11 and continuous infusional 5-FU. The interim analysis does not dismiss the possibility of a response rate that is 15% higher than that of the MTX + LFA-5-FU treatment.

The effectiveness of epoetin alfa in sustaining hemoglobin levels in cancer patients with hemoglobin below 12 g/dL has not been thoroughly assessed. In this study, breast cancer patients (N = 354) undergoing chemotherapy were randomly divided in equal proportions to receive either epoetin alfa (40,000 U once a week) or the standard of care (SOC). Quality of life was evaluated both at the beginning and after 12 weeks. Measurements included hemoglobin response, the need for transfusions, and factors predicting response outcomes. After 12 weeks, changes in scores for the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An) and FACT-An fatigue were significantly higher for the epoetin alfa group compared to SOC, with mean scores of 2.16 +/- 12.84 v -4.43 +/- 13.42 and 1.85 +/- 10.52 v -3.55 +/- 11.14 respectively (P < .0001). Hemoglobin response, defined as either a mean hemoglobin level of 12 g/dL or more, or an increase of 2 g/dL or higher from baseline, was significantly greater in the epoetin alfa group compared to SOC: 52.0% v 5.1% and 65.7% v 6.3% respectively (P < .0001 for both instances). The proportion of patients requiring transfusions was markedly lower in the epoetin alfa group compared to SOC, with figures standing at 8.6% v 22.9%.

We assigned 122 lymphoma patients either to standard care (n = 62) or to 12 weeks of guided aerobic exercise training (AET; n = 60). Our main measure for sleep outcomes was the overall sleep quality, evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The secondary measures included the scores of the PSQI components.

However, there is a scarcity of evidence concerning the effects of LLLT on a patient's subjective experiences of OM and QOL. Consequently, we conducted this study to assess how LLLT influences patients' reported experiences of OM and QOL in those with head and neck cancer (HNC) undergoing CRT. In this triple-blinded study, 220 HNC patients scheduled for CRT (consisting of Cisplatin administered every three weeks plus radiation therapy amounting to 66 Gray (2 Gy per session), five sessions a week over 6.5 weeks, totaling 33 sessions) were randomly divided into laser (110 participants) and placebo (110 participants) groups.

This investigation was structured as a 2 x 2 factorial trial with the objective of ensuring that the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate would not decrease by more than 5%. Additionally, the study evaluated patients' quality of life. Each cycle of BEP included etoposide 500 mg/m(2), given at 100 mg/m(2) on days 1 to 5 or 165 mg/m(2) on days 1 to 3, and cisplatin 100 mg/m(2), provided at either 20 mg/m(2) on days 1 to 5 or 50 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 2. Bleomycin at 30 mg was administered on days 1, 8, and 15 during cycles 1 to 3. The randomization process permitted some investigators to focus solely on the comparison of three versus four cycles. Between March 1995 and April 1998, 812 patients were randomly allocated to receive either three or four cycles; among these, 681 were also assigned to either the 5-day or 3-day schedule. The treatment arms were well-matched in terms of histology, marker values, and disease extent. The anticipated 2-year PFS is 90.4% for patients on three cycles and 89.4% for those on four cycles. The variation in PFS between three and four cycles is -1.0% (80% confidence limit [CL], ranging from -3.8% to +1.8%). The equivalence between three and four cycles is established as both the upper and lower bounds of the 80% CL are within 5%. In comparing the 5-day and 3-day schedules, the projected 2-year PFS is 88.8% and 89.7%, respectively, with a difference of -0.9% (80% CL, between -4.1% and +2.2%). Therefore, this comparison also supports the claim of equivalence. The incidences of both hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities were largely comparable.

{"id": "id_51", "input": "The World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for managing cancer pain advise beginning with nonopioid painkillers, progressing to a combination of so-called \"weak\" analgesics with nonopioid drugs as second-line therapy, and reserving \"strong\" opioids (paired with nonopioid analgesics) for third-line treatment. Nevertheless, these guidelines are open to scrutiny concerning their effectiveness and the logic behind not opting for strong opioids as initial therapy, particularly in terminal cancer patients. This randomized study aimed to prospectively assess the effectiveness and tolerability of strong opioids as first-line treatment compared to WHO recommendations in terminal cancer patients. A total of 100 patients experiencing mild to moderate pain were randomized to either follow WHO guidelines or start treatment with strong opioids. The outcomes assessed included pain intensity, necessity for therapy modification, quality of life, Karnofsky Performance Status, the overall condition of the patient, and any adverse effects. There were no observed differences between the treatment groups in terms of changes in quality of life or performance status,, whereas patients who began treatment with strong opioids experienced significantly greater pain relief compared to those treated following WHO guidelines (P=0.041).

A total of 419 women were randomly assigned to one of four treatment regimens: daily doses of 1 mg E2V/2.5 mg MPA (1 + 2.5 group); 1 mg E2V/5 mg MPA (1 + 5 group); 2 mg E2V/2.5 mg MPA (2 + 2.5 group); or 2 mg E2V/5 mg MPA (2 + 5 group) (Indivina, Orion Pharma). In the final six months, all participants received the 1 + 2.5 dosage. The 2 + 2.5 dosage was phased out by the end of year 7. A total of 198 women continued beyond year 7. Annual rates of cardiovascular events [corrected] and endometrial cancers [corrected] were lower than national averages in Finland and those documented in the Women's Health Initiative. The 1 + 2.5 dosage was associated with no severe events, both during treatment and after stopping ccHRT. Significant reductions in climacteric symptoms were sustained below initial levels even after decreasing the dosage; However, certain symptoms re-emerged following the cessation of ccHRT. Regardless of the dosage, HRQOL ratings saw enhancements, encompassing improvements in depressed mood, anxiety, general health perception, and sexual interest. Scores reflecting daily functioning and enjoyment, as measured by Q-LES-Q, showed positive changes from year 7 to year 9. These scores declined during the follow-up phase among women who did not continue ccHRT. HRT administered at lower dosages was equally effective as higher dosages in alleviating climacteric symptoms and enhancing HRQOL ratings, while presenting fewer safety concerns.

In our study, we evaluated the efficacy of docetaxel-carboplatin versus paclitaxel-carboplatin as initial chemotherapy for stage Ic-IV epithelial ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer. We randomly allocated 1077 patients to receive either docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m2 (administered as a 1-hour intravenous infusion) or paclitaxel at 175 mg/m2 (given over a 3-hour intravenous infusion). Both regimens were followed by carboplatin adjusted to achieve an area under the plasma concentration-time curve of 5. These treatments were repeated every three weeks for a total of six cycles, with an option for three additional cycles of carboplatin alone for patients who responded. Kaplan-Meier method was used to generate survival curves, and hazard ratios were calculated using the Cox proportional hazards model, with all statistical tests being two-sided. Following a median observation period of 23 months, both treatment groups exhibited comparable progression-free survival durations (15.0 months for docetaxel-carboplatin and 14.8 months for paclitaxel-carboplatin; hazard ratio [HR] for docetaxel versus paclitaxel = 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.83 to 1.13; P = .707), similar two-year overall survival rates (64.2% and 68.9%, respectively; HR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.92 to 1.39; P = .238), and similar objective tumor response rates (58.7% and 59.5%, respectively; difference = -0.8%, 95% CI = -8.6% to 7.1%; P = .868) as well as CA-125 response rates (75.8% and 76.8%, respectively; difference = -1.0%, 95% CI = -7.2% to 5.1%; P = .794).

Additionally, it aimed to conduct a preliminary comparison of these new regimens against a biweekly administration of LFA-5-FU modulated by methotrexate (MTX + LFA-5-FU). A total of 159 patients with advanced colorectal cancer, who had not previously been treated for metastatic disease (including 34 who had received adjuvant 5-FU), were randomly assigned to one of the following treatments: arm A received CPT-11, 200 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1, followed by LFA, 250 mg/m2 intravenously and 5-FU, 850 mg/m2 intravenously on day 2; arm B was given TOM, 3 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1, followed by LFA, 250 mg/m2 intravenously and 5-FU, 1050 mg/m2 intravenously on day 2; and arm C received MTX, 750 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1, followed by LFA, 250 mg/m2 intravenously and 5-FU, 800 mg/m2 intravenously on day 2. Each treatment course was repeated every two weeks. The response rate (RR) was assessed after every four treatment cycles. The study was powered at 80% to identify a 35% RR for each experimental therapy and to detect an RR difference of at least 4% compared to the standard treatment if the actual difference was 15% or more. The observed RRs were: arm A achieved a 34% RR (95% confidence interval (CI): 21%-48%), with 3 complete responses (CRs) and 15 partial responses (PRs); arm B showed a 24% RR (95% CI: 14%-38%), including 2 CRs and 11 PRs; and arm C also had a 24% RR (95% CI: 14%-38%), with 2 CRs and 11 PRs. After a median follow-up period of 62 weeks (ranging from 18 to 108 weeks), the median time until disease progression was calculated as 38 weeks for arm A, 25 weeks for arm B, and 27 weeks for arm C. With 94 patients remaining alive, the probability of survival at one year was estimated to be 61% for arm A, 54% for arm B, and 59% for arm C.

Participants with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer were randomly selected to receive either gemcitabine-carboplatin or carboplatin every three weeks. The main goal was to evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) between the two groups. From September 1999 to April 2002, a total of 356 patients were randomized to the treatment, with 178 receiving gemcitabine-carboplatin and the other 178 receiving only carboplatin. Patients underwent six cycles of either gemcitabine-carboplatin or carboplatin. After a median follow-up period of 17 months, the median PFS was 8.6 months for the gemcitabine-carboplatin group (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.9-9.7 months) compared to 5.8 months for the carboplatin group (95% CI 5.2-7.1 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.72 [95% CI 0.58-0.90; P = 0.0032]). The response rate observed in the gemcitabine-carboplatin cohort was 47.2% (95% CI 39.9-54.5%), whereas the carboplatin cohort had a response rate of 30.9% (95% CI 24.1-37.7%; P = 0.0016). The hazard ratio for overall survival was calculated to be 0.96 (95% CI 0.75-1.23; P = 0.7349). Patients receiving gemcitabine-carboplatin reported a notably quicker relief from abdominal symptoms and an enhanced overall quality of life. The administration of gemcitabine-carboplatin markedly enhances the progression-free survival of those with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "15839957", "framework": "abstrct", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 101, "to": 289}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 290, "to": 419}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1494, "to": 1782}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1783, "to": 1971}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1972, "to": 2067}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2068, "to": 2209}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2210, "to": 2362}], "label": "Claim", "id": 6}], "edges": [{"source": 6, "target": 2, "label": "AbstRCT_Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6]}

The effectiveness of epoetin alfa in sustaining hemoglobin levels in cancer patients with hemoglobin below 12 g/dL remains unassessed. In a study involving breast cancer patients (N = 354) undergoing chemotherapy, participants were randomly divided equally to receive either epoetin alfa (40,000 U weekly) or standard care (SOC). Quality of life (QOL) evaluations were conducted initially and after 12 weeks. Hemoglobin responses, necessity for transfusions, and factors predicting responses were measured. By week 12, the change scores for the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Anemia (FACT-An; mean, 2.16 +/- 12.84 for epoetin alfa compared to -4.43 +/- 13.42 for SOC) and FACT-An fatigue (mean, 1.85 +/- 10.52 for epoetin alfa versus -3.55 +/- 11.14 for SOC) were significantly higher in the epoetin alfa group (P < .0001). Hemoglobin responses, characterized by either a mean hemoglobin of 12 g/dL or higher or an increase of at least 2 g/dL from baseline, were notably more frequent in the epoetin alfa group compared to SOC: 52.0% versus 5.1% and 65.7% versus 6.3%, respectively (P < .0001 for both comparisons). The percentage of patients requiring transfusions was considerably less in the epoetin alfa group than in the SOC group (8.6% versus 22.9%).

Chemotherapy consisted of intravenous carboplatin at a dosage of 300 mg/m2 on the first day and oral etoposide at 120 mg/m2 from days 1 to 5, repeated every four weeks for up to eight cycles. Quality of life assessments were carried out at the start of the study, before each treatment cycle, and at equivalent intervals in the control group using the EORTC QLQ-C30 + LC13 questionnaire. A total of 48 patients were randomized (26 to supportive care, 22 to chemotherapy) and were eligible for comparative analysis. Additionally, another 102 patients, 97 of whom opted for chemotherapy, were included based on personal treatment preferences and their data served for confirmatory purposes. Patients receiving chemotherapy showed greater overall physical functioning and better symptom management compared to those in the supportive care group. The differences between the groups were less pronounced in the psychosocial aspects, although there was a tendency favoring the chemotherapy group. No notable advantages emerged for the supportive care group, except in terms of hair loss. The median survival was 29 weeks for those on chemotherapy compared to 11 weeks for the supportive care group, with 1-year survival rates at 28% versus 8% respectively.

{"id": "id_63", "input": "Individuals with lymphoma often face sleep disturbances, which might be alleviated by engaging in aerobic exercise, although this has not been previously investigated. In our study, we allocated 122 lymphoma patients either to a standard care group (n = 62) or a 12-week program of supervised aerobic exercise training (AET; n = 60). The main focus of our sleep assessment was the overall sleep quality, measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Additional focus was placed on the individual PSQI component scores. We also executed planned subgroup analyses. Analysis based on intention-to-treat revealed that AET led to a non-significant (P = 0.16) enhancement in overall sleep quality compared to standard care [mean group difference = -0.64; 95% confidence interval (CI), -1.56 to +0.27]. Significant or near-significant interactions were discovered in the planned subgroup analyses regarding lymphoma type (P(interaction) = 0.006), current treatment status (P(interaction) = 0.036), time elapsed since diagnosis (P(interaction) = 0.010), body mass index (P(interaction) = 0.075), and initial sleep quality (P(interaction) = 0.041). In particular, AET led to improved global sleep quality in lymphoma patients with indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (P = 0.001), those undergoing chemotherapy (P = 0.013), those diagnosed less than two years ago (P = 0.005), obese individuals (P = 0.025), and those with poor baseline sleep quality (P = 0.007). AET did not cause a significant enhancement in sleep quality across this varied group of lymphoma patients; however, certain clinically identifiable subgroups seemed to derive benefits.

In a phase II trial, the combination of DPPE and doxorubicin (DOX) in cases of metastatic breast cancer showed a higher response rate than what was anticipated from DOX alone. Here, we present a phase III trial contrasting the effects of DOX with the combination of DPPE and DOX in cases of metastatic or recurrent breast cancer. Women who had not previously been treated with anthracyclines and who had measurable metastatic disease were randomly assigned to receive either DOX 60 mg/m(2) intravenously every 21 days or DOX administered during the final 20 minutes of an 80-minute infusion of DPPE (5.3 mg/kg), with both groups reaching a cumulative DOX dose of 450 mg/m(2).

The study's objectives included progression-free survival (PFS), response rate (RR), and response duration (RD), along with quality of life (QOL), toxicity, and overall survival (OS). An interim analysis that was planned did not reveal an RR difference greater than 5%. Consequently, the study ceased enrolling new participants, and all use of DPPE was stopped. The final analysis proceeded as scheduled following 256 progression events (median follow-up, 20.5 months). The results showed no significant differences in RR, RD, or PFS between the two groups.

A few trials, including our recent publication, have demonstrated that low-level laser therapy (LLLT) possesses some preventive and therapeutic benefits against clinically observed objective indicators of OM. However, there is a scarcity of data regarding its impact on the subjective experiences of OM and QOL from the patient's perspective. Therefore, we conducted this study to assess how LLLT affects the self-reported outcomes of OM and QOL in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients undergoing CRT. This triple-blind study randomly assigned 220 HNC patients, who were scheduled for CRT (three-weekly Cisplatin + RT = 66 Gray (2 Gy/session), five fractions per week for 6.5 weeks, totaling 33 fractions), into two groups: laser (110) and placebo (110).

The research was structured as a 2 x 2 factorial trial, aiming to confirm that the reduction in the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate would not exceed 5%. Additionally, the study looked into the quality of life experienced by patients. A BEP cycle involved etoposide at 500 mg/m(2), administered either at 100 mg/m(2) from days 1 through 5, or at 165 mg/m(2) from days 1 to 3, and cisplatin at 100 mg/m(2), administered either at 20 mg/m(2) from days 1 through 5, or at 50 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 2. Bleomycin 30 mg was given on days 1, 8, and 15 during cycles 1 through 3. Some investigators could choose to only participate in the comparison between three and four cycles due to the randomization process. Between March 1995 and April 1998, a total of 812 patients were randomly selected to undergo either three or four cycles, with 681 of them also randomized into either the 5-day or 3-day schedule. Histological data, marker values, and disease severity were well equilibrated across treatment groups in both comparisons. The anticipated 2-year PFS stands at 90.4% for three cycles and 89.4% for four cycles. The variation in PFS between three and four cycles is -1.0% (with an 80% confidence interval [CI] of -3.8% to +1.8%). Equivalence between three and four cycles is asserted since both the upper and lower bounds of the 80% CI are below the 5% threshold. In comparing the 5-day schedule to the 3-day schedule, the estimated 2-year PFS is 88.8% and 89.7%, respectively, with a difference of -0.9% (80% CI, -4.1% to +2.2%).

However, these recommendations raise questions regarding their effectiveness and the justification for delaying the use of strong opioids, particularly in terminal cancer patients. This randomized study aimed to directly compare the efficacy and tolerability of initiating treatment with strong opioids versus following the WHO guidelines in terminal cancer patients. A total of 100 patients experiencing mild to moderate pain were randomly assigned to receive treatment per WHO recommendations or to start with strong opioids. The evaluated outcomes included pain severity, frequency of therapy adjustments, quality of life, Karnofsky Performance Status, overall patient condition, and adverse events. There were no significant differences between the treatment groups in terms of changes in quality of life or performance status, although patients who began treatment with strong opioids experienced noticeably greater pain relief compared to those managed according to WHO guidelines (P=0.041). Moreover, patients initially treated with strong opioids required fewer therapy adjustments, achieved more substantial pain reduction when changes were made, and expressed higher satisfaction with their treatment compared to the group following WHO recommendations (P=0.041).

In our study, we evaluated the efficacy of the docetaxel-carboplatin combination against the paclitaxel-carboplatin combination as the initial chemotherapy choice for patients with stage Ic-IV epithelial ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer. We enrolled 1077 patients, assigning them randomly to receive either docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m2 (administered via a 1-hour intravenous infusion) or paclitaxel at 175 mg/m2 (administered via a 3-hour intravenous infusion). Carboplatin was then administered to reach an area under the plasma concentration-time curve of 5. These treatments were repeated every three weeks for a total of six cycles, with an option for an additional three cycles of carboplatin alone for patients showing a response. Survival analyses were conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method, and hazard ratios were calculated with the Cox proportional hazards model, using two-sided statistical tests throughout. With a median follow-up duration of 23 months, both treatment groups showed comparable progression-free survival times (median of 15.0 months for docetaxel-carboplatin and 14.8 months for paclitaxel-carboplatin; hazard ratio [HR] docetaxel versus paclitaxel = 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.83 to 1.13; P = .707), as well as similar overall survival rates at the 2-year mark (64.2% for docetaxel and 68.9% for paclitaxel; HR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.92 to 1.39; P = .238), objective tumor response (58.7% for docetaxel and 59.5% for paclitaxel; difference = -0.8%, 95% CI = -8.6% to 7.1%; P = .868), and CA-125 response rates (75.8% for docetaxel and 76.8% for paclitaxel; difference = -1.0%, 95% CI = -7.2% to 5.1%; P = .794).

Despite this, myelosuppression did not negatively impact dose delivery or compromise patient safety. The overall quality of life scores were comparable between the two treatment arms, though significant differences in various symptom scores were observed, favoring the docetaxel treatment. Docetaxel-carboplatin appears to offer similar outcomes to paclitaxel-carboplatin regarding progression-free survival and response rates, but additional follow-up is necessary to make a conclusive determination about survival benefits.

Treatments were repeated every two weeks across all groups. The response rate (RR) was assessed after every four treatment cycles. The sample size was calculated to have an 80% chance of detecting a 35% RR for each experimental treatment and to reveal a difference of at least 4% in RR compared to the standard treatment if the actual difference is 15% or more. The RRs were: 34% (95% confidence interval: 21%-48%) in Group A, including 3 complete responses and 15 partial responses, 24% (95% CI: 14%-38%) in Group B, with 2 complete responses and 11 partial responses, and 24% (95% CI: 14%-38%) in Group C, with 2 complete responses and 11 partial responses. Following a median observation period of 62 weeks (ranging from 18 to 108 weeks), the median duration until disease progression was 38 weeks for Group A, 25 weeks for Group B, and 27 weeks for Group C. Out of 94 patients who remained alive, the one-year survival probability was 61% for Group A, 54% for Group B, and 59% for Group C. In patients treated with CPT-11 + LFA-5-FU, WHO grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and diarrhea were observed in 46% and 16% of cases, respectively.

Severe side effects associated with TOM + LFA-5-FU included neutropenia (16%) and diarrhea (16%), while the median relative DI8 was 93% for TOM and 82% for 5-FU. The CPT-11 + LFA-5-FU regimen shows favorable outcomes in terms of activity and toxicity when compared to other combination treatments involving CPT-11 and continuous infusional 5-FU.

We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving misoprostol in head and neck cancer patients. The study aimed to assess the effectiveness of topical misoprostol in alleviating the severity of mucositis caused by radiation therapy in patients receiving radical doses. Additionally, we explored the impact of this treatment on the overall well-being of the patients. The primary focus of the study was the occurrence of grade 3 mucositis as defined by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group. From 1999 to 2002, 83 patients were enrolled in the study at Westmead and Nepean Hospitals in Sydney, with 42 patients assigned to the misoprostol group and 41 to the placebo group. A majority of the participants were treated with radiotherapy in the adjuvant setting (52 out of 83) and were diagnosed with either oral cavity cancer (42 out of 83) or oropharyngeal cancer (16 out of 83). We did not observe any notable difference in the occurrence of severe mucositis when comparing patients treated with misoprostol to those given a placebo. The mean area under the mucositis curve showed no considerable variation (13.2 vs 16.6; P = 0.1). Those receiving misoprostol reported slightly higher levels of soreness (7.6 vs 6.9; P = 0.04) and increased analgesic use. Nonetheless, this did not result in a diminished sense of overall well-being, as indicated by a straightforward visual analogue scale (5.8 vs 5.2; P = 0.3). Ultimately, we found no evidence of a reduction in radiation-induced mucositis among patients treated with misoprostol. There is a significant lack of high-quality evidence regarding effective interventions, underscoring the need for ongoing research that incorporates assessments of quality of life in patients suffering from radiation-induced mucositis.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "16981945", "framework": "abstrct", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 247, "to": 345}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1352, "to": 1506}], "label": "Claim", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1507, "to": 1604}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1605, "to": 1728}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1729, "to": 1885}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1886, "to": 2005}], "label": "Claim", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2006, "to": 2241}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 6}], "edges": [{"source": 3, "target": 4, "label": "AbstRCT_Partial-Attack"}, {"source": 5, "target": 2, "label": "AbstRCT_Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 3, "label": "AbstRCT_Partial-Attack"}], "tops": [0, 1, 5, 6]}

For patients experiencing disease recurrence at least 6 months post-initial therapy, the combination of paclitaxel and platinum has been demonstrated to be more effective than platinum alone. Nevertheless, a significant number of patients experience clinically significant neurotoxicity, often leading to the discontinuation of treatment. The potential effectiveness and safety of an alternative treatment plan, which does not lead to notable neurotoxicity, were assessed by comparing gemcitabine-carboplatin against carboplatin alone in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. This comparison was conducted through a Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup trial by the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynakologische Onkologie Ovarian Cancer Study Group, the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group, and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Gynaecological Cancer Group. Participants whose ovarian cancer recurred and was sensitive to platinum were randomly assigned to receive either gemcitabine-carboplatin or carboplatin every three weeks. The main goal was to contrast the progression-free survival (PFS) between these groups. From September 1999 to April 2002, 356 patients were randomized to treatment, with 178 receiving gemcitabine-carboplatin and the other 178 receiving only carboplatin. Patients underwent six treatment cycles of either gemcitabine-carboplatin or carboplatin. With a median follow-up period of 17 months, the median PFS was recorded at 8.6 months for those on gemcitabine-carboplatin (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.9-9.7 months) compared to 5.8 months for those on carboplatin (95% CI 5.2-7.1 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.72 [95% CI 0.58-0.90; P = 0.0032]). The response rate was 47.2% (95% CI 39.9-54.5%) for the gemcitabine-carboplatin group, while it was 30.9% for the carboplatin group (95% CI 24.1-37.7%; P = 0.0016). The hazard ratio for overall survival was 0.96 (95% CI 0.75-1.23; P = 0.7349).

The chemotherapy regimen included intravenous administration of 300 mg/m2 carboplatin on the first day and 120 mg/m2 of oral etoposide from days 1 to 5, repeated every four weeks for a maximum of eight cycles. Quality of life assessments were conducted at the time of randomization, before each treatment cycle, and at equivalent 4-week intervals for the control group, using the EORTC QLQ-C30 + LC13 questionnaire.

In our study, we randomly allocated 122 lymphoma patients to either standard care (n = 62) or a regimen of 12 weeks of supervised aerobic exercise training (AET; n = 60). The primary endpoint for sleep was the overall sleep quality, measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), while secondary endpoints included the specific PSQI component scores.

A cycle involved etoposide at a dose of 500 mg/m(2), given either as 100 mg/m(2) on days 1 to 5 or 165 mg/m(2) on days 1 to 3, and cisplatin at 100 mg/m(2), administered either as 20 mg/m(2) from days 1 to 5 or 50 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 2. Bleomycin 30 mg was given on days 1, 8, and 15 during the first three cycles. The randomization allowed certain researchers to focus only on comparing three versus four cycles. Between March 1995 and April 1998, 812 participants were randomly assigned to either three or four cycles, with 681 of them also randomly allocated to the 5-day or 3-day schedule. Histology, marker values, and disease extent were evenly distributed across the treatment groups in both comparisons. The anticipated 2-year PFS is 90.4% for three cycles and 89.4% for four cycles. The PFS difference between three and four cycles is -1.0% (80% confidence interval [CI], -3.8% to +1.8%). Equivalence between three and four cycles is asserted since both ends of the 80% CI are below 5%. In comparing the 5-day to the 3-day schedule, the expected 2-year PFS is 88.8% and 89.7%, respectively (difference of -0.9%, 80% CI, -4.1% to +2.2%). Therefore, equivalence is also asserted for this schedule comparison. The occurrence of hematologic and nonhematologic side effects was largely similar. Patients who underwent three cycles reported better maintenance of quality of life; no significant differences were observed between the 3-day and 5-day treatment durations. In conclusion, administering three cycles of BEP, with etoposide at 500 mg/m(2), constitutes adequate therapy for germ cell cancer with a good prognosis and delivering chemotherapy over a 3-day schedule does not impair the efficacy of the BEP regimen.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "11250991", "framework": "abstrct", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 1208, "to": 1287}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1288, "to": 1393}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1394, "to": 1491}], "label": "Claim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1492, "to": 1641}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1653, "to": 1711}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1712, "to": 1794}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1795, "to": 1878}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1879, "to": 1968}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1984, "to": 2121}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2126, "to": 2220}], "label": "Claim", "id": 9}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 1, "label": "AbstRCT_Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "AbstRCT_Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 0, "label": "AbstRCT_Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 2, "label": "AbstRCT_Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 6, "label": "AbstRCT_Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 4, "label": "AbstRCT_Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 7, "label": "AbstRCT_Support"}], "tops": [5, 8, 9]}

Nevertheless, there is room to challenge these guidelines regarding their effectiveness and the reasoning behind not deploying strong opioids as the primary treatment, particularly for those with terminal cancer. The aim of this randomized study was to forwardly assess the effectiveness and tolerability of potent opioids as the first choice compared to the WHO's recommendations in terminal cancer patients. A group of 100 patients experiencing mild to moderate pain were randomly allocated to either the WHO guideline treatment or strong opioid treatment. The outcomes measured included pain severity, necessity for therapy modification, life quality, Karnofsky Performance Status, the patient's overall state, and side effects. There were no differences observed between the treatments in terms of changes in quality of life or performance status, but patients who began treatment with strong opioids experienced significantly better pain relief than those following the WHO guidelines (P=0.041). Moreover, those starting with strong opioids needed significantly fewer therapy adjustments, experienced a greater decrease in pain when changes were made, and expressed higher satisfaction with their treatment compared to the other group (P=0.041). Strong opioids were found to be safe and well-tolerated, with no signs of tolerance development or severe adverse events.

The study involved 419 women who were assigned to one of four treatment regimens: daily doses of 1 mg E2V/2.5 mg MPA (1 + 2.5 group); 1 mg E2V/5 mg MPA (1 + 5 group); 2 mg E2V/2.5 mg MPA (2 + 2.5 group); or 2 mg E2V/5 mg MPA (2 + 5 group), all from Indivina, Orion Pharma. In the final six months, every participant switched to the 1 + 2.5 dosage. The 2 + 2.5 dosage was phased out after year 7, and 198 women continued beyond this point. The annualized rates for cardiovascular incidents and endometrial cancers, after corrections, were found to be lower than both Finnish national rates and those reported by the Women's Health Initiative. The 1 + 2.5 dosage and post-therapy cessation were associated with no severe incidents. After reducing the dosage, climacteric symptoms were significantly lower than their initial baseline. However, some symptoms reappeared once ccHRT was stopped. Regardless of the dosage, ccHRT led to improvements in HRQOL, including better mood, reduced anxiety, enhanced health perception, and increased sexual interest. From year 7 to year 9, scores on a measure of daily functioning and enjoyment (Q-LES-Q) showed enhancement. In contrast, these scores declined during follow-up for women who did not continue ccHRT. Lower doses of HRT were equally effective as higher doses in alleviating climacteric symptoms and enhancing HRQOL, while posing fewer safety risks. Upon ceasing ccHRT, patient satisfaction varied; 15% chose to continue or restart HRT, with 7% resuming during the follow-up.

Quality of life is a crucial concern for patients with pancreatic cancer. At the Department of Oncology, Kaunas University of Medicine Hospital, a prospective randomized clinical trial was undertaken to explore the treatment of patients with both resectable and unresectable pancreatic cancer, focusing on quality of life. The objective of this research was to evaluate the impact of combined treatment methods on the quality of life for those diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Between 2000 and 2005, two simultaneous chemoradiation treatment approaches (radiotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and radiotherapy with gemcitabine) were examined. Sixty patients participated in the study, including 41 with resectable cancer and 19 with unresectable cancer. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) questionnaire was used to assess quality of life. Three primary quality of life scales (overall health status, functional, and symptom scales) were evaluated and compared between the two treatment groups. The quality of life assessment analysis revealed a statistically significant decline in quality of life post-treatment in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer who underwent radiotherapy and gemcitabine.

This research focused on the disparity in QOL between older adults (65+) and younger adults (18-64) with advanced cancer, following a comprehensive intervention aimed at enhancing QOL. Registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, the study involved newly diagnosed advanced cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy, who were randomly assigned to either a QOL intervention group or a control group. Participants in the intervention group attended six 90-minute sessions that targeted the five key QOL domains. Assessments of QOL (using Linear Analogue Self-Assessment (LASA) and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G)) and mood (via Profile of Mood States (POMS)) were conducted at baseline, and at weeks 4, 27, and 52.

{"id": "id_91", "input": "The standard treatment for ovarian carcinoma involves chemotherapy using a platinum compound and a taxane, specifically paclitaxel. Our study compared the efficacy of combining docetaxel-carboplatin with paclitaxel-carboplatin as the initial chemotherapy approach for stage Ic-IV epithelial ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer. We randomly selected 1077 patients to receive either docetaxel at a dosage of 75 mg/m2 via a one-hour intravenous infusion or paclitaxel at 175 mg/m2 administered over three hours. Post-treatment, both groups received carboplatin aimed at an area under the plasma concentration-time curve of 5. Treatments were repeated every three weeks for six cycles, with an option for three additional cycles of carboplatin alone for patients showing response. Survival rates were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and hazard ratios were determined through the Cox proportional hazards model. All statistical analyses were conducted using two-sided tests. Following a median observation period of 23 months, both treatment groups exhibited comparable progression-free survival durations, with medians of 15.0 months for the docetaxel-carboplatin group and 14.8 months for the paclitaxel-carboplatin group (hazard ratio [HR] for docetaxel versus paclitaxel = 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.83 to 1.13; P = .707). Additionally, the two-year overall survival rates were similar (64.2% for docetaxel-carboplatin and 68.9% for paclitaxel-carboplatin; HR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.92 to 1.39; P = .238), along with comparable objective tumor response rates (58.7% and 59.5%, respectively; difference = -0.8%, 95% CI = -8.6% to 7.1%; P = .868) and CA-125 response rates (75.8% and 76.8%, respectively; difference = -1.0%, 95% CI = -7.2% to 5.1%; P = .794). Nevertheless, the docetaxel-carboplatin regimen resulted in notably lower overall and grade 2 or higher neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel-carboplatin (grade \u22652 neurosensory toxicity occurred in 11% versus 30%, difference = 19%, 95% CI = 15% to 24%; P<.001; grade \u22652 neuromotor toxicity was observed in 3% versus 7%, difference = 4%, 95% CI = 1% to 7%; P<.001).

Despite this, the occurrence of myelosuppression did not affect dose delivery or compromise patient safety. Overall quality of life was consistent across both treatment groups, though significant differences in various symptom scores were observed, favoring the docetaxel group. The effectiveness of docetaxel-carboplatin appears comparable to paclitaxel-carboplatin in terms of progression-free survival and response rates, although further follow-up is necessary to make a definitive conclusion regarding survival.

Each treatment course was repeated every two weeks across all arms of the study. The response rate (RR) was assessed after every four courses. The sample size was calculated to ensure an 80% probability of detecting a 35% RR for each experimental approach and to demonstrate a difference of at least 4% in RR compared to the standard treatment if the actual difference is 15% or more. The RRs observed were: 34% (95% confidence interval: 21%-48%) in arm A, consisting of 3 complete responses (CRs) and 15 partial responses (PRs), 24% (95% CI: 14%-38%) in arm B, comprising 2 CRs and 11 PRs, and 24% (95% CI: 14%-38%), with 2 CRs and 11 PRs, in arm C. Following a median follow-up duration of 62 weeks (ranging from 18 to 108 weeks), the median time to disease progression was noted to be 38 weeks for arm A, 25 weeks for arm B, and 27 weeks for arm C. With 94 patients still surviving, the probability of survival at one year was 61%, 54%, and 59% for arms A, B, and C, respectively. WHO grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and diarrhea were observed in 46% and 16% of the patients who received the CPT-11 + LFA 5-FU treatment.

Serious toxicities associated with TOM + LFA-5-FU included neutropenia (16%) and diarrhea (16%), but the median relative DI8 was 93% for TOM and 82% for 5-FU. In terms of both efficacy and side effects, CPT-11 + LFA-5-FU compares favorably with other combination regimens that include CPT-11 and continuous infusional 5-FU. Based on this interim analysis, we cannot dismiss the hypothesis of a RR being 15% higher than that achieved with the MTX + LFA-5-FU treatment.

{"id": "id_95", "input": "Radiation-induced mucositis represents a common acute complication affecting the mucosa in patients undergoing radiotherapy for head and neck cancers, often leading to severe discomfort and limiting the radiation dose that can be administered. No widely accepted treatment has proven to significantly alleviate its severity. Misoprostol, a synthetic derivative of prostaglandin E1, is known for its mucosal protective properties. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study on misoprostol involving patients with head and neck cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether topical application of misoprostol could effectively lessen the severity of mucositis caused by radiation in patients undergoing radical dose radiotherapy. Additionally, the impact of this treatment on patients' overall health was assessed. The main focus of the study was the occurrence of grade 3 mucositis as classified by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group. From 1999 to 2002, 83 patients were enrolled in the study at Westmead and Nepean Hospitals in Sydney. Of these, 42 patients were randomly assigned to receive misoprostol and 41 to receive a placebo. The majority of participants underwent radiotherapy in the adjuvant setting (52 out of 83) and had oral cavity (42 out of 83) or oropharyngeal (16 out of 83) cancer. The study did not reveal any notable differences in the occurrence of severe mucositis between the group receiving misoprostol and the placebo group. The average area under the mucositis curve showed no significant variation (13.2 compared to 16.6; P = 0.1). Patients treated with misoprostol reported marginally higher soreness levels (7.6 versus 6.9; P = 0.04) and increased analgesic consumption. However, this did not correspond to a decreased sense of overall well-being, as indicated by a basic visual analogue scale (5.8 versus 5.2; P = 0.3). Ultimately, the research failed to demonstrate a reduction in radiation-induced mucositis among those treated with misoprostol.

In a study conducted by the Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup, encompassing groups such as the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynakologische Onkologie Ovarian Cancer Study Group, the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group, and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Gynaecological Cancer Group, the effectiveness and safety of an alternative regimen, which doesn't lead to substantial neurotoxicity, were assessed by contrasting gemcitabine-carboplatin with carboplatin in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either gemcitabine-carboplatin or carboplatin every 21 days, with the primary goal of comparing progression-free survival (PFS) between these groups. Between September 1999 and April 2002, 356 patients were randomized for treatment, with 178 receiving gemcitabine-carboplatin and the other 178 receiving only carboplatin. Each patient underwent six cycles of their respective treatment. Following a median follow-up period of 17 months, the median PFS was recorded at 8.6 months for those on gemcitabine-carboplatin (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.9-9.7 months) versus 5.8 months for those on carboplatin (95% CI 5.2-7.1 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.72 [95% CI 0.58-0.90; P = 0.0032]).

The chemotherapy consisted of an intravenous dose of carboplatin at 300 mg/m2 on the first day, followed by oral etoposide at 120 mg/m2 from days 1 to 5, repeated every four weeks for up to eight rounds. Quality of life was evaluated at the start of randomisation, before each treatment course, and at comparable four-week intervals for those only receiving supportive care, using the EORTC QLQ-C30 + LC13 questionnaire. A total of 48 patients were allocated randomly, with 26 receiving supportive care and 22 undergoing chemotherapy, and were suitable for comparative analysis. An additional 102 patients, of whom 97 opted for chemotherapy based on individual preference, were later included for validation purposes. Those in the chemotherapy group experienced better physical functioning and symptom management compared to the supportive care group. Differences between the two groups were less pronounced in the psychosocial area, even though there were trends suggesting benefits for the chemotherapy group.

Initially, all participants underwent four cycles of cisplatin and etoposide every three weeks (step 1; PE). Those showing stable or improved disease were then randomly assigned to either observation or four cycles of topotecan (1.5 mg/m\u00b2/day for 5 consecutive days, every three weeks; step 2).

Designed as a 2 x 2 factorial trial, the objective was to ensure that the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate does not drop by more than 5%. Patient quality of life was also evaluated. Each BEP cycle included etoposide dosed at either 100 mg/m(2) from day 1 to 5 or 165 mg/m(2) from day 1 to 3, and cisplatin dosed at either 20 mg/m(2) from day 1 to 5 or 50 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 2. Bleomycin at 30 mg was given on days 1, 8, and 15 during the first three cycles. Some researchers were only involved in the three versus four cycles comparison due to randomization. Between March 1995 and April 1998, 812 patients were randomly allocated to receive either three or four cycles; within this group, 681 patients were further randomized to the 5-day or 3-day schedule. The treatment arms were well-balanced in terms of histology, marker values, and disease extent. The estimated 2-year PFS rates are 90.4% for patients on three cycles and 89.4% for those on four cycles. The PFS difference between the three- and four-cycle groups stands at -1.0% (80% confidence interval [CI], ranging from -3.8% to +1.8%). The equivalence between three and four cycles is supported, as both the upper and lower limits of the 80% CI fall below the 5% threshold. For the 5-day versus 3-day treatment schedule, the projected 2-year PFS is 88.8% and 89.7%, respectively, with a difference of -0.9% (80% CI, from -4.1% to +2.2%). Consequently, equivalence is also established for this comparison. Both hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities occurred at similar rates. Patients receiving three cycles experienced better maintenance of their quality of life; there were no notable differences between the 3-day and 5-day treatment durations. In conclusion, a regimen of three cycles of BEP, with etoposide dosed at 500 mg/m(2), suffices for treating good-prognosis germ cell cancer and that delivering the chemotherapy regimen over 3 days does not compromise the efficacy of the BEP treatment.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "11250991", "framework": "abstrct", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 1128, "to": 1233}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1234, "to": 1370}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1371, "to": 1508}], "label": "Claim", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1509, "to": 1672}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1687, "to": 1739}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1740, "to": 1813}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1814, "to": 1902}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1903, "to": 1985}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2001, "to": 2125}], "label": "Claim", "id": 8}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2135, "to": 2237}], "label": "Claim", "id": 9}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 1, "label": "AbstRCT_Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "AbstRCT_Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 0, "label": "AbstRCT_Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 2, "label": "AbstRCT_Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 6, "label": "AbstRCT_Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 4, "label": "AbstRCT_Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 7, "label": "AbstRCT_Support"}], "tops": [5, 8, 9]}

Nonetheless, the efficacy of these guidelines and the reasoning behind not utilizing strong opioids from the outset, particularly in terminal cancer patients, can be challenged. This randomized study aimed to compare, in a forward-looking manner, the effectiveness and tolerance of strong opioids as initial agents against the WHO's recommendations in patients with terminal cancer. A total of one hundred patients experiencing mild to moderate pain were randomly assigned to either follow the WHO guidelines or receive strong opioids. The outcomes assessed included pain intensity, the necessity for therapy adjustments, quality of life, Karnofsky Performance Status, the patient's overall condition, and any adverse events. There were no observed differences between treatments concerning changes in quality of life or performance status, yet patients who began treatment with strong opioids experienced significantly greater pain relief compared to those treated based on WHO guidelines (P=0.041). Moreover, patients initiating treatment with strong opioids needed notably fewer therapy changes, saw a more significant decrease in pain when changes were made, and expressed higher treatment satisfaction than those in the comparison group (P=0.041).

Three principal quality of life scales, namely general health status, functional, and symptom scales, were evaluated and compared across the two treatment groups. Evaluating the quality of life indicated a statistically notable reduction in quality of life post-treatment among patients with resectable pancreatic cancer who underwent radiotherapy with gemcitabine.

In our study, we evaluated the effectiveness of the docetaxel-carboplatin combination against the paclitaxel-carboplatin duo as initial chemotherapy for stage Ic-IV epithelial ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer. We randomly allocated 1077 patients to receive either docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 (administered intravenously over 1 hour) or paclitaxel at 175 mg/m2 (administered intravenously over 3 hours), followed by carboplatin at a targeted plasma concentration-time curve of 5. These treatments were administered every three weeks for six cycles, with the possibility of three additional cycles of single-agent carboplatin for those showing positive responses. Survival statistics were generated using the Kaplan-Meier approach, while hazard ratios were determined using the Cox proportional hazards model. All statistical analyses were conducted with a two-sided approach. With a median follow-up duration of 23 months, the progression-free survival was comparable between the two groups, with medians of 15.0 months for the docetaxel-carboplatin group and 14.8 months for the paclitaxel-carboplatin group (hazard ratio [HR] docetaxel-paclitaxel = 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.83 to 1.13; P = .707).

Patients eligible for the study, showing either complete or partial response to combination chemotherapy (with or without thoracic or prophylactic cranial radiation), were administered oral vandetanib at a dose of 300 mg daily or a matching placebo. With a sample size of 100 participants and 77 events recorded, the study was powered at 80% to discern an increase in median progression-free survival from 4 months to 6.5 months, using a one-sided test at the 10% significance level. Conducted between May 2003 and March 2006, the trial enrolled 107 patients, with 46 having limited disease and 61 presenting extensive disease. In the vandetanib group, fewer patients had a performance status of 0 (11 versus 20), and fewer achieved complete response to initial therapy (4 versus 8). Patients treated with vandetanib experienced higher toxicity levels and needed more dose adjustments due to gastrointestinal issues and skin rashes. In eight patients receiving vandetanib, asymptomatic prolongation of the Corrected QT interval (QTC) was detected. The median progression-free survival was 2.7 months for vandetanib compared to 2.8 months for the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 80% confidence interval [CI], 0.75 to 1.36; one-sided P = .51).

A randomized trial was conducted to compare uterine-artery embolization with surgical procedures in women experiencing symptomatic uterine fibroids. The main objective was to assess the quality of life one year after treatment, using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36) as a measure. Participants were randomly allocated in a 2:1 ratio to undergo either uterine-artery embolization or surgery, with 106 patients receiving embolization and 51 undergoing surgical procedures (43 hysterectomies and 8 myomectomies). No significant differences were found between the two groups across any of the eight components of the SF-36 scores after one year. Patients in the embolization group experienced a shorter median hospital stay compared to those in the surgical group (1 day versus 5 days, P<0.001) and returned to work sooner (P<0.001). When assessed after one year, symptom scores were superior in the surgical group (P=0.03).

Currently, there is no established intervention that is widely accepted for significantly alleviating its severity. Misoprostol, a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin E1, is known for its mucosal protective properties. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy of misoprostol in mitigating the severity of radiation-induced mucositis in patients receiving high-dose radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. Additionally, the study examined the impact of this treatment on patients' overall well-being. The primary focus was on the occurrence of grade 3 mucositis as classified by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group. From 1999 to 2002, a total of 83 patients were enrolled in the study conducted at Westmead and Nepean Hospitals in Sydney. Of these, 42 were randomly assigned to receive misoprostol while 41 received a placebo. The majority of participants were treated in an adjuvant setting (52 out of 83), with 42 having oral cavity cancer and 16 diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer. We found no significant difference in the rate of severe mucositis between patients treated with misoprostol and those given a placebo. The comparison of the mean area under the mucositis curve showed no statistically significant difference (13.2 vs 16.6; P = 0.1). Patients receiving misoprostol reported a minor increase in soreness (7.6 vs 6.9; P = 0.04) and used more pain relief medication. Nevertheless, this increase in soreness did not adversely affect the patients' general well-being, as assessed by a simple visual analogue scale (5.8 vs 5.2; P = 0.3).

Nonetheless, numerous patients experience significant neurotoxicity, which often leads to the discontinuation of the treatment. The effectiveness and safety profile of an alternative treatment regimen that minimizes significant neurotoxicity were assessed by comparing the gemcitabine-carboplatin combination with carboplatin alone in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. This was conducted as part of a Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup trial involving the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynakologische Onkologie Ovarian Cancer Study Group, the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group, and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Gynaecological Cancer Group. Subjects who had recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer were randomly allocated to receive either gemcitabine-carboplatin or carboplatin every 21 days. The main aim was to evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) across the two groups. Between September 1999 and April 2002, 356 patients (with an equal split of 178 participants receiving gemcitabine-carboplatin and 178 receiving carboplatin only) were randomized for treatment. They underwent six cycles of either the gemcitabine-carboplatin regimen or carboplatin therapy. Following a median follow-up period of 17 months, the median progression-free survival was 8.6 months for the gemcitabine-carboplatin group (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.9-9.7 months) compared to 5.8 months for the carboplatin group (95% CI 5.2-7.1 months; hazard ratio [HR] 0.72 [95% CI 0.58-0.90; P = 0.0032]).

The study included patients with measurable or assessable disease and an ECOG performance status ranging from 0 to 2; patients with stable brain metastases were also eligible. Initially, all patients underwent four cycles of cisplatin and etoposide every three weeks (step 1; PE). Those whose disease was stable or responding were then randomly assigned to either continued monitoring or four cycles of topotecan (1.5 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days, every three weeks; step 2). A total of 402 eligible patients participated in step 1, with 223 eligible for step 2 (observation, n = 111; topotecan, n = 112). The rates of complete and partial response to the initial PE treatment were 3% and 32%, respectively. Topotecan yielded a response rate of 7%, with 2% achieving complete response and 5% partial response. The median survival duration for all 402 eligible participants was calculated at 9.6 months. The progression-free survival (PFS) from the start of randomization in step 2 was significantly longer with topotecan compared to observation (3.6 months versus 2.3 months; P <.001). Nonetheless, The overall survival from the date of randomization in step 2 showed no significant difference between the observation and topotecan groups (8.9 months compared to 9.3 months; P =.43). Among patients in step 1 receiving PE, 50% experienced grade 4 neutropenia and 3% thrombocytopenia, whereas in step 2, 60% of topotecan patients faced grade 4 neutropenia and 13% thrombocytopenia. Grade 4/5 infection occurred in 4.6% of patients treated with PE and 1.8% among those given topotecan. Grade 3/4 anemia developed in 22% of individuals who received topotecan. There was no observable difference in quality of life between the groups receiving topotecan and those under observation at any point of assessment or across any subscale scores. Administering four cycles of PE followed by four cycles of topotecan enhanced PFS but did not lead to improvements in overall survival or quality of life for patients with extensive-stage SCLC.

Designed as a 2 x 2 factorial trial, the goal was to ensure that there would be no more than a 5% drop in the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate. The study also took into account the patients' quality of life. A cycle of BEP included etoposide at a dose of 500 mg/m(2), given either as 100 mg/m(2) over days 1 to 5 or as 165 mg/m(2) over days 1 to 3, along with cisplatin at 100 mg/m(2), administered either as 20 mg/m(2) over days 1 to 5 or as 50 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 2. Bleomycin was given at 30 mg on days 1, 8, and 15 during cycles 1 to 3. Researchers were able to participate in the three versus four cycle comparison through a randomization process. Between March 1995 and April 1998, 812 participants were randomly assigned to either three or four cycles; among them, 681 were also randomly assigned to either the 5-day or 3-day schedule. The treatment arms were well-balanced in terms of histology, marker values, and disease extent. The estimated 2-year PFS stands at 90.4% for those on three cycles and 89.4% for those on four cycles. The PFS difference between three and four cycles is calculated to be -1.0%, with an 80% confidence limit ranging from -3.8% to +1.8%. The equivalency between three and four cycles is asserted, as both the upper and lower bounds of the 80% confidence limit fall below 5%. For the comparison between 5-day and 3-day treatments, the projected 2-year PFS is 88.8% and 89.7%, respectively, with a difference of -0.9% (80% CL, -4.1%, +2.2%). Consequently, equivalence is similarly claimed in the comparison between 5-day and 3-day treatments. The occurrence rates of both hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities were largely similar. Patients receiving three cycles experienced better preservation of quality of life. No distinctions were found between the 3-day and 5-day treatment schedules.

{"id": "id_123", "input": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the guidelines for addressing cancer pain recommend starting with nonopioid analgesics as the initial therapy, followed by so-called \"weak\" analgesics in combination with nonopioids as the secondary option, and reserving \"strong\" opioids (paired with nonopioids) solely for the third phase of treatment. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of these guidelines and the reasoning behind not employing strong opioids from the outset, particularly for terminal cancer patients, can be challenged. This randomized study aimed to prospectively assess the effectiveness and tolerability of strong opioids as initial treatment compared to the WHO's recommendations in terminal cancer patients. A total of 100 patients experiencing mild to moderate pain were randomly assigned to either follow WHO guidelines or receive strong opioids as treatment. The outcomes measured included pain intensity, necessity for therapy modification, quality of life, Karnofsky Performance Status, overall patient condition, and adverse effects. There were no observed differences between the treatments in terms of alterations in quality of life or performance status, but patients who commenced treatment with strong opioids experienced notably superior pain relief compared to those following WHO guidelines (P=0.041). Furthermore, individuals who began with strong opioids needed significantly fewer therapy adjustments, showed a more pronounced reduction in pain when changes were made, and expressed greater satisfaction with their treatment than those in the comparison group (P=0.041).

All treatment cycles were repeated biweekly. The response rate (RR) was assessed after every four courses. The study's sample size was calculated to provide an 80% chance to detect a 35% RR for each experimental treatment, while highlighting any difference of at least 4% in RR compared to the standard treatment if a true difference of 15% or more exists. The RRs achieved were: 34% (95% confidence interval (CI): 21%-48%) in arm A, with 3 complete responses (CRs) and 15 partial responses (PRs); 24% (95% CI: 14%-38%) in arm B, with 2 CRs and 11 PRs; and 24% (95% CI: 14%-38%) with 2 CRs and 11 PRs in arm C.

With 100 participants and 77 events recorded, the study was designed to have an 80% chance of identifying an increase in median progression-free survival from 4 to 6.5 months (using a one-sided test at a 10% significance level). Between May 2003 and March 2006, 107 patients were enrolled; 46 had limited-stage disease and 61 had extensive-stage disease. In the vandetanib group, fewer patients had a performance status of 0 (n = 11 compared to 20), and fewer achieved CR following initial treatment (n = 4 compared to 8). Patients receiving vandetanib experienced more side effects and required more adjustments to their doses due to gastrointestinal issues and skin rashes. Eight patients taking vandetanib showed a prolongation of the asymptomatic Corrected QT interval (QTC).

This can lead to significant discomfort and may limit the dosage of treatment. Currently, there is no universally accepted intervention that effectively diminishes its severity. Misoprostol, a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin E1, acts as a cytoprotective agent for mucosal tissues. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of misoprostol in patients with head and neck cancer. The study aimed to determine if applying misoprostol topically could lessen the severity of mucositis caused by radiation in patients receiving radical doses of radiotherapy. Additionally, we evaluated the overall impact of this intervention on patients' general health. The primary focus of the study was the occurrence of grade 3 mucositis according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria. From 1999 to 2002, 83 participants were enrolled in the study at Westmead and Nepean Hospitals in Sydney, with 42 randomized to the misoprostol group and 41 to the placebo group. The majority of participants received radiotherapy as an adjuvant treatment, and most had either oral cavity cancer or oropharyngeal cancer. We found no significant difference in the occurrence of severe mucositis between patients treated with misoprostol and those given a placebo. The mean area under the mucositis curve showed no significant disparity (13.2 vs 16.6; P = 0.1).

For patients whose disease recurs at least six months after the first round of treatment, the combination of paclitaxel and platinum has proven to be more effective than using platinum alone. Nevertheless, a significant number of these patients experience clinically significant neurotoxicity, often leading to an early halt of the treatment. To examine the effectiveness and safety of an alternative regimen that avoids considerable neurotoxicity, a comparison was made between gemcitabine-carboplatin and carboplatin in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. This study was conducted through a Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup trial involving the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynakologische Onkologie Ovarian Cancer Study Group, the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group, and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Gynaecological Cancer Group. Participants with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer were randomly assigned to receive either gemcitabine-carboplatin or carboplatin every 21 days.

The research was executed as a 2 x 2 factorial trial. The goal was to ensure that the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate did not decrease by more than 5%. Additionally, the study evaluated patient quality of life. A cycle of BEP included etoposide 500 mg/m(2), administered either as 100 mg/m(2) over days 1 to 5 or 165 mg/m(2) over days 1 to 3, and cisplatin 100 mg/m(2), given either as 20 mg/m(2) over days 1 to 5 or 50 mg/m(2) over days 1 and 2. Bleomycin at 30 mg was administered on the 1st, 8th, and 15th days during cycles 1 through 3. The randomization process allowed some researchers to solely partake in the three versus four cycle comparison. Between March 1995 and April 1998, 812 patients were randomly allocated to either three or four cycles, with 681 also assigned to the 5-day or 3-day schedule.

For three cycles, the anticipated 2-year PFS is 90.4%, while for four cycles it is 89.4%. The PFS difference between the three and four cycles stands at -1.0% (with an 80% confidence limit [CL] ranging from -3.8% to +1.8%). Equivalence between three and four cycles is asserted since both the lower and upper bounds of the 80% CL are below 5%.

Consequently, equivalence is also asserted for this comparison. The occurrence rates of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities were essentially identical. Patients undergoing three cycles showed better preservation of quality of life; no disparities were found between the 3-day and 5-day treatment durations.

Nonetheless, there are valid concerns about the effectiveness of this protocol and the logic behind excluding strong opioids from first-line treatment, particularly for terminal cancer patients. This randomized study aimed to directly compare the efficacy and tolerability of strong opioids as initial treatment against the standard WHO recommendations in terminal cancer patients.

No significant adverse events were associated with the 1 + 2.5 dosage or following the cessation of ccHRT. Climacteric symptoms were noticeably reduced from baseline figures even after the dosage was lowered. However, some symptoms reappeared once ccHRT was stopped. HRQOL scores improved with the use of ccHRT across all dosages, with positive changes noted in mood, anxiety, health perception, and sexual interest. From year 7 to year 9, there was enhancement in scores measuring daily functioning and enjoyment (Q-LES-Q). These scores declined during the follow-up among women who did not continue with ccHRT. Lower doses of HRT proved to be as effective as higher ones in alleviating climacteric symptoms and boosting HRQOL, with reduced safety issues.

We randomly assigned 1077 participants to receive either docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 (administered intravenously over one hour) or paclitaxel at 175 mg/m2 (administered intravenously over three hours).

A total of 159 patients with advanced colorectal cancer, who had not previously received treatment for metastatic disease (including 34 who had undergone adjuvant 5-FU therapy), were randomly assigned to the following treatments: Arm A received CPT-11, 200 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1, followed by LFA, 250 mg/m2 intravenously and 5-FU, 850 mg/m2 intravenously as a bolus on day 2; Arm B was given TOM, 3 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1, followed by LFA, 250 mg/m2 intravenously and 5-FU, 1050 mg/m2 intravenously as a bolus on day 2; Arm C was administered MTX, 750 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1, followed by LFA, 250 mg/m2 intravenously and 5-FU, 800 mg/m2 intravenously as a bolus on day 2. All treatment courses were repeated every two weeks across the trial arms. Response rate (RR) was assessed after every four cycles of treatment. The study's sample size was calculated to ensure an 80% likelihood of detecting a 35% RR for each experimental therapy and to demonstrate a minimum of a 4% RR difference with the standard treatment, assuming the actual difference is 15% or higher. The RRs achieved were 34% (95% confidence interval (95%, CI): 21%-48%) in arm A, with 3 complete responses (CRs) and 15 partial responses (PRs); 24% (95% CI: 14%-38%) in arm B, including 2 CRs and 11 PRs; and 24% (95% CI: 14%-38%), with 2 CRs and 11 PRs, in arm C. Following a median follow-up period of 62 weeks (ranging from 18 to 108 weeks), the median time until disease progression was noted to be 38 weeks for arm A, 25 weeks for arm B, and 27 weeks for arm C. Out of the total participants, 94 patients remained alive, with the one-year survival probability recorded at 61% for arm A, 54% for arm B, and 59% for arm C. In the treatment group receiving CPT-11 + LFA 5-FU, severe neutropenia (WHO grade 3 or 4) was observed in 46% of patients, while 16% experienced diarrhea. The median relative dose intensity over eight treatment cycles (DI8) was calculated to be 78% for CPT-11 and 82% for 5-FU. For the TOM + LFA-5-FU treatment, significant toxicities included neutropenia and diarrhea, each affecting 16% of patients. The median relative DI8 was 93% for TOM and 82% for 5-FU. The combination of CPT-11 + LFA-5-FU demonstrated a favorable balance of efficacy and toxicity compared to other regimens incorporating CPT-11 and continuous infusional 5-FU. The interim analysis does not eliminate the possibility of a RR that is 15% higher than that achieved with the MTX + LFA-5-FU regimen.

This condition can lead to severe complications and may limit the radiation dose that can be administered. Currently, no widely accepted strategy exists that effectively mitigates its severity. Misoprostol, a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin E1, is known for its mucosal protective properties. To assess its efficacy, we organized a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving patients with head and neck cancer. The goal was to evaluate whether topical misoprostol could effectively lessen the severity of mucositis caused by radiation in patients receiving high-dose radiotherapy. Additionally, we explored how this treatment might impact the overall well-being of the patients. The study's main focus was on the occurrence of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grade 3 mucositis. From 1999 to 2002, we recruited 83 patients at Westmead and Nepean Hospitals in Sydney, assigning 42 to receive misoprostol and 41 to a placebo group. A majority were undergoing radiotherapy as an adjuvant treatment (52 out of 83), with cancers located either in the oral cavity (42 out of 83) or the oropharynx (16 out of 83). Our findings showed no meaningful difference in severe mucositis occurrence between the misoprostol and placebo groups.

Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has demonstrated some preventive and therapeutic benefits against objectively measured OM in a few trials, including our recently published research. However, there is a lack of substantial evidence regarding LLLT's effects on a patient's personal experience of OM and QOL. Consequently, we conducted this study to assess the impact of LLLT on patient-reported outcomes related to OM and QOL in individuals with head and neck cancer (HNC) undergoing CRT. In this triple-blind study, 220 HNC patients slated for CRT (three weekly Cisplatin + RT = 66 Gray (2 Gy/session), five sessions per week for 6.5 weeks, totaling 33 sessions) were randomly assigned to either the laser group (110 patients) or the placebo group (110 patients). The laser group received LLLT (Technomed Electronics Advanced Laser Therapy 1000, He-Ne, \u03bb = 632.8 nm, power density = 24 mW/cm\u00b2, dosage = 3.0 J at each point, total dose/session = 36-40 J, spot size 1 cm\u00b2, irradiation time/point 125 s) prior to each radiation session, whereas the placebo group did not undergo laser therapy. The methodology mirrored that of our recent publication (Gautam et al. Radiother Oncol 104:349-354, 2012). In this segment of our study, a blinded evaluator gathered subjective data on OM using the Oral Mucositis Weekly Questionnaire-Head and Neck (OMWQ-HN) and assessed QOL using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment-Head and Neck (FACT-HN) Questionnaire. The data underwent analysis via repeated measure ANOVA employing a general linear model, with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Analysis of the results indicated that both OMWQ-HN (F = 12.199, df = 6,1314, p < 0.001) and FACT-HN (p < 0.05) scores were notably lower in the LLLT group compared to the placebo group.

Patients eligible for the study had either measurable or assessable disease and an ECOG performance status ranging from 0 to 2, with stable brain metastases being permissible. Initially, all participants underwent four cycles of cisplatin and etoposide every three weeks (step 1; PE). Those showing stable or responsive disease were subsequently randomized to either a period of observation or four cycles of topotecan (1.5 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days, every 3 weeks; step 2). A total of 402 eligible participants were enrolled in step 1, and 223 eligible participants proceeded to step 2 (observation, n = 111; topotecan, n = 112). Initial treatment with PE resulted in complete and partial response rates of 3% and 32%, respectively. The response rate for topotecan stood at 7%, with complete responses at 2% and partial responses at 5%. The median survival duration for all 402 eligible patients was calculated to be 9.6 months. Progression-free survival (PFS) from the randomization date in step 2 was significantly longer with topotecan than with observation (3.6 months versus 2.3 months; P <.001).

Conducted as a 2 x 2 factorial trial, the aim was to ensure that the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate did not decrease by more than 5%. Additionally, patient quality of life was evaluated. Each BEP cycle included etoposide 500 mg/m(2), given either at 100 mg/m(2) over days 1 to 5 or 165 mg/m(2) over days 1 to 3, and cisplatin 100 mg/m(2), given either at 20 mg/m(2) over days 1 to 5 or 50 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 2.

Our study aimed to compare the efficacy of docetaxel-carboplatin against paclitaxel-carboplatin as initial chemotherapy for patients with stage Ic-IV epithelial ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer. We randomly allocated 1077 participants to receive either docetaxel at 75 mg/m2 via a 1-hour intravenous infusion or paclitaxel at 175 mg/m2 over a 3-hour infusion.

All statistical analyses were conducted with a two-sided approach. After a median observation period of 23 months, both treatment groups exhibited comparable progression-free survival durations (median of 15.0 months for the docetaxel-carboplatin group and 14.8 months for the paclitaxel-carboplatin group; hazard ratio [HR] for docetaxel versus paclitaxel = 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.83 to 1.13; P = .707), similar overall survival rates at two years (64.2% versus 68.9%; HR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.92 to 1.39; P = .238), and analogous objective tumor response rates (58.7% compared to 59.5%; difference = -0.8%, 95% CI = -8.6% to 7.1%; P = .868) and CA-125 response rates (75.8% against 76.8%; difference = -1.0%, 95% CI = -7.2% to 5.1%; P = .794).

The docetaxel-carboplatin combination seems to match paclitaxel-carboplatin in terms of progression-free survival and response, though more extended follow-up is necessary to make a conclusive statement concerning survival.

{"id": "id_164", "input": "The purpose of this randomized trial was to assess the effectiveness and side effects of a biweekly regimen involving 6S-leucovorin-enhanced 5-fluorouracil (LFA-5-FU), paired with either irinotecan (CPT-11 + LFA 5-FU) or raltitrexed (Tomudex) (TOM + LFA-5-FU), in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Additionally, a preliminary comparison was made between these experimental regimens and a biweekly schedule of LFA-5-FU augmented by methotrexate (MTX + LFA-5-FU). A total of 159 patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma who had not been previously treated for metastatic disease (34 of whom had prior exposure to adjuvant 5-FU) were randomly assigned to receive: CPT-11, 200 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1, followed on day 2 by LFA, 250 mg/m2 intravenous infusion and 5-FU, 850 mg/m2 intravenous bolus (arm A); TOM, 3 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1, followed on day 2 by LFA, 250 mg/m2 intravenous infusion and 5-FU, 1050 mg/m2 intravenous bolus (arm B); or MTX, 750 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1, followed on day 2 by LFA, 250 mg/m2 intravenous infusion and 5-FU, 800 mg/m2 intravenous bolus (arm C). Each arm of the trial repeated courses every two weeks. Response rates (RR) were assessed after every four courses. The sample size was calculated to have an 80% chance to identify a 35% RR for each experimental treatment, and to demonstrate a difference of at least 4% in RR with the standard treatment if the actual difference is 15% or greater. The RRs were: 34% (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 21%-48%) in arm A, comprising 3 complete responses (CRs) and 15 partial responses (PRs), 24% (95% CI: 14%-38%) in arm B, including 2 CRs and 11 PRs, and 24% (95% CI: 14%-38%), with 2 CRs and 11 PRs, in arm C. Following a median follow-up duration of 62 weeks (ranging from 18 to 108 weeks), the median time until disease progression was 38 weeks for arm A, 25 weeks for arm B, and 27 weeks for arm C. Among the 94 patients who remained alive, the probability of surviving one year was 61% for arm A, 54% for arm B, and 59% for arm C. WHO grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and diarrhea affected 46% and 16% of patients, respectively, in the CPT-11 + LFA 5-FU treatment group. Over eight cycles, the median relative dose intensity (DI8) was 78% for CPT-11 and 82% for 5-FU. Severe toxicities observed in the TOM + LFA-5-FU regimen included neutropenia (16%) and diarrhea (16%), whereas the median relative DI8 was 93% for TOM and 82% for 5-FU. The combination of CPT-11 + LFA-5-FU demonstrates favorable activity and toxicity profiles compared to other regimens that include CPT-11 and continuous infusional 5-FU. Based on this interim analysis, the hypothesis that the RR is 15% higher than that of the MTX + LFA-5-FU treatment cannot be dismissed.

Patients eligible for the trial, having achieved either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to combination chemotherapy, with or without thoracic or prophylactic cranial radiation, were administered either 300 mg of oral vandetanib daily or a placebo. The study involved 100 patients and 77 events, providing 80% power to identify an increase in median progression-free survival from 4 to 6.5 months, using a one-sided test at the 10% level. From May 2003 to March 2006, a total of 107 patients participated; among them, 46 had limited disease while 61 had extensive disease. In the vandetanib group, fewer participants had a performance status of 0 (n = 11 versus 20), and fewer achieved a CR to initial treatment (n = 4 versus 8). Patients treated with vandetanib experienced higher toxicity levels and needed more dose adjustments due to gastrointestinal side effects and rash.

{"id": "id_167", "input": "Radiation-induced mucositis is a common acute condition affecting the mucosa of individuals undergoing head and neck radiotherapy, often leading to severe and dose-limiting side effects. Currently, there is no universally accepted intervention that effectively diminishes its severity. Misoprostol, a synthetic prostaglandin E1 analogue, serves as a mucosal cytoprotectant. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of misoprostol in patients with head and neck cancer. The study aimed to assess whether topical misoprostol could alleviate the intensity of radiation-induced mucositis in individuals receiving radical dose radiotherapy, while also examining its impact on overall patient well-being. The primary goal was to observe the occurrence of grade 3 mucositis, as classified by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group. From 1999 to 2002, 83 participants were enrolled in the trial at Westmead and Nepean Hospitals, Sydney. Among them, 42 were randomly assigned to receive misoprostol, and 41 were given a placebo. The majority of participants (52 out of 83) received radiotherapy in an adjuvant setting and had either oral cavity (42 out of 83) or oropharyngeal (16 out of 83) cancer. Our findings revealed no notable difference in the occurrence of severe mucositis between patients treated with misoprostol and those given a placebo. The comparison of the mean area under the mucositis curve showed no significant disparity (13.2 vs 16.6; P = 0.1). Patients who received misoprostol reported a slight increase in soreness (7.6 vs 6.9; P = 0.04) and a higher consumption of pain relief medications. Nevertheless, this difference did not correspond to a worsened sense of overall well-being, as gauged by a straightforward visual analogue scale (5.8 vs 5.2; P = 0.3). Ultimately, our study did not demonstrate a reduction in radiation-induced mucositis among patients treated with misoprostol.

Researchers compared the effectiveness and safety of a different regimen lacking notable neurotoxicity by evaluating gemcitabine-carboplatin against carboplatin in patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. This study was conducted by the Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup trial, associated with the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynakologische Onkologie Ovarian Cancer Study Group, the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group, and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Gynaecological Cancer Group. Participants diagnosed with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer were randomly assigned to receive either gemcitabine-carboplatin or carboplatin every three weeks.

Our main focus was on assessing overall sleep quality using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), with secondary outcomes being the individual PSQI component scores.

We present findings from a phase III trial contrasting DOX with the combination of DPPE and DOX in cases of metastatic or recurrent breast cancer. Women who had not previously been treated with anthracyclines and who had measurable metastatic disease were randomly assigned to receive either DOX 60 mg/m(2) intravenously every 21 days or DOX during the final 20 minutes of an 80-minute DPPE (5.3 mg/kg) infusion, both aiming for a cumulative DOX dose of 450 mg/m(2).

Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) has demonstrated some preventive and healing effects on clinically observed objective indicators of OM in several trials, including one we recently published. However, there is a scarcity of evidence concerning LLLT's impact on patients' subjective experiences of OM and their QOL. Therefore, we conducted this study to examine how LLLT influences patient-reported outcomes of OM and QOL in individuals with head and neck cancer (HNC) undergoing CRT. In this triple-blind study, 220 HNC patients scheduled for CRT (Cisplatin every three weeks combined with radiotherapy totaling 66 Gray at 2 Gy per session, spread over five fractions per week for 6.5 weeks, amounting to 33 fractions) were randomly assigned to either the laser group (110 patients) or the placebo group (110 patients).

Participants were randomly allocated to receive either 500 mg of fulvestrant (administered intramuscularly [IM] on day 0, with subsequent doses on days 14, 28, and then every 28 days) or the 250 mg dose every 28 days. The primary outcome measured was progression-free survival (PFS), with secondary outcomes including objective response rate, clinical benefit rate (CBR), duration of clinical benefit (DoCB), overall survival (OS), and quality of life (QOL). The PFS was notably extended for patients receiving the 500 mg dose of fulvestrant (n = 362) compared to those on the 250 mg regimen (n = 374), with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) ranging from 0.68 to 0.94; P = .006, equating to a 20% reduction in the risk of disease progression.

This study was structured as a 2 x 2 factorial trial, aiming to exclude a 5% reduction in the 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate. The study also considered the patients' quality of life. A BEP cycle included etoposide at 500 mg/m(2), given either at 100 mg/m(2) daily from day 1 to 5 or at 165 mg/m(2) daily from day 1 to 3, and cisplatin at 100 mg/m(2), administered either at 20 mg/m(2) daily from day 1 to 5 or at 50 mg/m(2) daily on days 1 and 2. Bleomycin at 30 mg was given on days 1, 8, and 15 during cycles 1 through 3. Some investigators were allowed to participate only in the comparison between three versus four cycles due to the randomization process. Between March 1995 and April 1998, a total of 812 patients were randomly assigned to either three or four cycles, with 681 also randomly assigned to either the 5-day or 3-day schedule. The treatment arms of the two comparisons were well-balanced in terms of histology, marker values, and disease extent. The estimated 2-year PFS stands at 90.4% for three cycles and at 89.4% for four cycles. The PFS difference between three and four cycles is -1.0% (with an 80% confidence interval [CI] of -3.8% to +1.8%). Equivalence between three and four cycles is asserted, as both the upper and lower limits of the 80% CI are below 5%. In the comparison of 5-day versus 3-day schedules, the estimated 2-year PFS is 88.8% and 89.7%, respectively, with a difference of -0.9% (80% CI of -4.1% to +2.2%). Therefore, equivalence is also claimed in this scheduling comparison. The rates of hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities were fundamentally similar. Patients who received three cycles experienced better preservation of their quality of life; no significant differences were observed between the 3-day and 5-day treatment durations.

{"id": "id_181", "input": "The standard treatment for ovarian carcinoma typically involves chemotherapy using a platinum agent in combination with a taxane like paclitaxel. In our study, we evaluated the efficacy of a docetaxel-carboplatin regimen against the conventional paclitaxel-carboplatin combination for initial chemotherapy in patients with stage Ic-IV epithelial ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer. Our trial involved the random allocation of 1077 patients to receive either docetaxel at a dosage of 75 mg/m2 through a 1-hour intravenous infusion or paclitaxel at 175 mg/m2 over a 3-hour infusion. Following this, carboplatin was administered to achieve a specific area under the plasma concentration-time curve of 5. This treatment cycle was repeated every three weeks up to six times; additional cycles of single-agent carboplatin were allowed for patients showing a positive response. Survival statistics were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method, and hazard ratios were calculated with the Cox proportional hazards model, ensuring all statistical tests were two-sided. Following a median observation period of 23 months, both treatment groups exhibited comparable progression-free survival rates (with medians of 15.0 months for the docetaxel-carboplatin group and 14.8 months for the paclitaxel-carboplatin group; hazard ratio [HR] for docetaxel versus paclitaxel = 0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.83 to 1.13; P = .707), as well as similar overall survival percentages at the two-year mark (64.2% and 68.9%, respectively; HR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.92 to 1.39; P = .238), and similar tumor response and CA-125 response rates (58.7% and 59.5%, respectively; difference = -0.8%, 95% CI = -8.6% to 7.1%; P = .868) and (75.8% and 76.8%, respectively; difference = -1.0%, 95% CI = -7.2% to 5.1%; P = .794). On the other hand, the docetaxel-carboplatin combination was linked to significantly lower rates of overall neurotoxicity and grade 2 or higher neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel-carboplatin (grade \u22652 neurosensory toxicity seen in 11% versus 30% of patients, difference = 19%, 95% CI = 15% to 24%; P<.001; grade \u22652 neuromotor toxicity in 3% versus 7% of patients, difference = 4%, 95% CI = 1% to 7%; P<.001). However, treatment with docetaxel-carboplatin resulted in a statistically significant increase in grade 3-4 neutropenia (94% versus 84%, difference = 11%, 95% CI = 7% to 14%; P<.001) and associated neutropenic complications, compared to paclitaxel-carboplatin. Nonetheless, the occurrence of myelosuppression did not affect the delivery of the dose or compromise patient safety. Overall quality of life assessments showed no significant difference between the two treatment groups, although notable improvements in several symptom scores were observed in favor of docetaxel. The docetaxel-carboplatin regimen seems to offer similar results to paclitaxel-carboplatin regarding progression-free survival and response rates, though extended follow-up is necessary to make a conclusive statement about overall survival. Consequently, docetaxel-carboplatin stands as a viable alternative for first-line chemotherapy in patients newly diagnosed with ovarian cancer.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "15547181", "framework": "abstrct", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 1062, "to": 1797}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1798, "to": 2208}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2209, "to": 2469}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2470, "to": 2587}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2588, "to": 2690}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 4}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2691, "to": 2783}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 5}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2784, "to": 2930}], "label": "Claim", "id": 6}, {"anchors": [{"from": 2931, "to": 3024}], "label": "Claim", "id": 7}, {"anchors": [{"from": 3025, "to": 3168}], "label": "MajorClaim", "id": 8}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "AbstRCT_Partial-Attack"}, {"source": 4, "target": 5, "label": "AbstRCT_Partial-Attack"}, {"source": 5, "target": 1, "label": "AbstRCT_Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 0, "label": "AbstRCT_Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "AbstRCT_Partial-Attack"}, {"source": 8, "target": 6, "label": "AbstRCT_Support"}], "tops": [2, 4, 8]}
{"id": "id_182", "input": "The purpose of this randomized trial was to assess both the effectiveness and side effects of a biweekly schedule incorporating 6S-leucovorin-modulated 5-fluorouracil (LFA-5-FU), in conjunction with either irinotecan (CPT-11 + LFA 5-FU) or raltitrexed (Tomudex) (TOM + LFA-5-FU), for patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Additionally, a preliminary comparison was made between these experimental approaches and a biweekly dosage of LFA-5-FU enhanced with methotrexate (MTX + LFA-5-FU). A total of one hundred fifty-nine patients with advanced colorectal cancer, who had not been treated for metastatic disease before (34 of whom had previously received adjuvant 5-FU), were randomly assigned to the following treatment groups: CPT-11, 200 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1, followed on day 2 by LFA, 250 mg/m2 via intravenous infusion and 5-FU, 850 mg/m2 intravenous bolus (arm A); TOM, 3 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1, followed on day 2 by LFA, 250 mg/m2 via intravenous infusion and 5-FU, 1050 mg/m2 intravenous bolus (arm B); or MTX, 750 mg/m2 intravenously on day 1, followed on day 2 by LFA, 250 mg/m2 via intravenous infusion and 5-FU, 800 mg/m2 intravenous bolus (arm C). All treatment cycles were repeated every two weeks in each arm of the study. The response rate (RR) was assessed after every four treatment cycles. The sample size was established to ensure an 80% probability of detecting a 35% RR for each experimental therapy and to demonstrate at least a 4% difference in RR compared to the standard treatment, assuming the actual difference is 15% or more. The observed RRs were: 34% (95% confidence interval (95%, CI): 21%-48%) in arm A, consisting of 3 complete responses (CRs) and 15 partial responses (PRs), 24% (95% CI: 14%-38%) in arm B, consisting of 2 CRs and 11 PRs, and 24% (95% CI: 14%-38%), with 2 CRs and 11 PRs, in arm C. After a median follow-up period of 62 weeks, ranging from 18 to 108 weeks, the median time until disease progression was 38, 25, and 27 weeks for arms A, B, and C, respectively. Out of 94 patients still living, the probability of surviving for one year was estimated to be 61%, 54%, and 59% for arms A, B, and C, respectively. WHO grade 3 or 4 neutropenia and diarrhea affected 46% and 16% of patients receiving CPT-11 + LFA 5-FU, respectively. Over eight cycles, the median relative dose intensity (DI8) was 78% for CPT-11 and 82% for 5-FU. The severe toxicities observed with TOM + LFA-5-FU were neutropenia (16%) and diarrhea (16%), while the median relative DI8 was 93% for TOM, and 82% for 5-FU. In terms of activity and toxicity, CPT-11 + LFA-5-FU shows favorable comparison to other combination regimens that include CPT-11 and continuous infusional 5-FU. The hypothesis that the RR is 15% greater than that of the MTX + LFA-5-FU treatment remains plausible following this interim analysis.

Patients eligible for the study, having achieved either a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) from combination chemotherapy (with or without thoracic or preventive cranial radiation), were administered 300 mg of oral vandetanib daily or an identical placebo. With a cohort of 100 patients and 77 events occurring, the trial was designed with 80% power to identify an increase in median progression-free survival from 4 months to 6.5 months (conducted as a one-sided, 10%-level test). Between May 2003 and March 2006, 107 patients were recruited; 46 had limited disease and 61 had extensive disease. There were fewer patients with a performance status of 0 (11 versus 20) and fewer patients achieved CR from initial therapy (4 versus 8) in the vandetanib arm. Patients in the vandetanib group experienced higher toxicity levels and needed more dose adjustments due to gastrointestinal issues and rash. Eight patients receiving vandetanib displayed asymptomatic prolongation of the Corrected QT interval (QTC). The median progression-free survival was virtually the same for vandetanib and placebo groups, recorded at 2.7 months and 2.8 months respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 80% CI, 0.75 to 1.36; one-sided P = .51).

The main focus was the quality of life one year after the procedure, assessed using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form General Health Survey (SF-36). Participants were randomly divided in a 2:1 ratio between uterine-artery embolization and surgical intervention, with 106 patients receiving embolization and 51 undergoing surgery, comprising 43 hysterectomies and 8 myomectomies.

{"id": "id_185", "input": "Radiation-induced mucositis is a common acute reaction affecting the mucous membranes of patients undergoing radiotherapy for head and neck cancers, and it can lead to severe and dose-limiting consequences. There is currently no agreed-upon intervention that effectively lessens its severity. Misoprostol, a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin E1, is known for its mucosal protective properties. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of misoprostol in patients with head and neck cancer. The study aimed to assess whether topical misoprostol could effectively lessen the severity of radiation-induced mucositis in those receiving radical dose radiotherapy. Additionally, we looked into the intervention's impact on patients' overall well-being. The primary outcome was the occurrence of grade 3 mucositis as classified by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group. From 1999 to 2002, 83 participants were enrolled at Westmead and Nepean Hospitals in Sydney. Of these, 42 were randomly assigned to receive misoprostol, while 41 were given a placebo. Most participants underwent radiotherapy in an adjuvant context (52 out of 83) and had cancers located either in the oral cavity (42 out of 83) or the oropharynx (16 out of 83). We were unable to detect any notable difference in the occurrence of severe mucositis between patients treated with misoprostol and those given a placebo. The mean area under the mucositis curve showed no significant variation (13.2 compared to 16.6; P = 0.1). Participants who received misoprostol reported slightly more soreness (7.6 versus 6.9; P = 0.04) and a higher consumption of pain relief medications. Nonetheless, this did not equate to a decline in general well-being as gauged by a straightforward visual analogue scale (5.8 versus 5.2; P = 0.3).

The effectiveness and safety profile of an alternative treatment, which does not exhibit notable neurotoxic effects, were assessed by juxtaposing gemcitabine-carboplatin with carboplatin in individuals with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. This was conducted in a trial by the Gynecologic Cancer InterGroup, involving the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Gynakologische Onkologie Ovarian Cancer Study Group, the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group, and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Gynaecological Cancer Group. Individuals with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer were randomly assigned to receive either gemcitabine-carboplatin or carboplatin in cycles every 21 days. The study primarily aimed to contrast the progression-free survival (PFS) rates between the two groups. From September 1999 to April 2002, a total of 356 patients were randomized for treatment, with 178 participants receiving gemcitabine-carboplatin and 178 receiving carboplatin alone.

The chemotherapy regimen included 300 mg/m2 of intravenous (i.v.) carboplatin on the first day and 120 mg/m2 of oral etoposide from the first to the fifth day, repeated every four weeks for up to eight cycles. Quality of life assessments were conducted at the time of randomisation and before each treatment cycle, as well as at four-week intervals in the control group, using the EORTC QLQ-C30 + LC13 questionnaire. A total of 48 patients were randomised (26 received supportive care, 22 underwent chemotherapy), qualifying them for comparative analysis. An additional 102 patients, 97 of whom opted for chemotherapy, were included on the basis of individual treatment preference, and their data served to confirm the findings. Patients who received chemotherapy demonstrated superior physical functioning and better management of symptoms compared to those who were given only supportive care. The differences between groups were less pronounced in the psychosocial area, though there were trends indicating a preference for the chemotherapy group. There were no notable advantages observed for the supportive care group, with the exception of hair loss.

{"id": "id_189", "input": "Individuals diagnosed with lymphoma often face sleep disturbances that might be alleviated through aerobic exercise, yet this aspect hasn't been explored in previous research. We conducted a study where 122 lymphoma patients were randomly assigned either to receive standard care (n = 62) or engage in 12 weeks of guided aerobic exercise training (AET; n = 60). The main outcome measured was the overall sleep quality evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), while secondary outcomes focused on the individual PSQI component scores. We also carried out predetermined subgroup analyses. The intention-to-treat analysis revealed that AET resulted in a nonsignificant (P = 0.16) enhancement in overall sleep quality when compared to standard care [mean group difference = -0.64; 95% confidence interval (CI), -1.56 to +0.27]. Subgroup analyses that were planned showed statistically significant or borderline significant interactions for lymphoma type (P(interaction) = 0.006), current treatment stage (P(interaction) = 0.036), time elapsed since diagnosis (P(interaction) = 0.010), body mass index (P(interaction) = 0.075), and initial sleep quality (P(interaction) = 0.041). In particular, AET enhanced overall sleep quality in lymphoma patients who had indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (P = 0.001), were undergoing chemotherapy (P = 0.013), were diagnosed less than two years ago (P = 0.005), were obese (P = 0.025), and had poor initial sleep quality (P = 0.007). AET did not lead to a significant improvement in sleep quality within this diverse group of lymphoma patients; however, certain clinically identifiable subgroups seemed to benefit. Future studies on exercise targeting these responsive subgroups are essential to validate these results. If these findings are confirmed in larger, more specialized trials, aerobic exercise could become a promising approach for managing sleep disturbances in cancer patients, given its positive safety profile and additional health benefits.", "topic": null, "demo_id": "22523181", "framework": "abstrct", "nodes": [{"anchors": [{"from": 604, "to": 840}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 0}, {"anchors": [{"from": 841, "to": 1191}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 1}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1207, "to": 1479}], "label": "Evidence", "id": 2}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1480, "to": 1590}], "label": "Claim", "id": 3}, {"anchors": [{"from": 1591, "to": 1660}], "label": "Claim", "id": 4}], "edges": [{"source": 3, "target": 0, "label": "AbstRCT_Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 4, "label": "AbstRCT_Partial-Attack"}, {"source": 4, "target": 2, "label": "AbstRCT_Support"}], "tops": [1, 3]}

A phase II study integrating DPPE with doxorubicin (DOX) for treating metastatic breast cancer showed a better response than what is typically observed with DOX alone. We present a phase III study comparing DOX with a combination of DPPE and DOX in cases of metastatic or recurrent breast cancer. Women who had not previously been treated with anthracyclines and had measurable metastatic disease were randomly assigned to receive either DOX at a dosage of 60 mg/m(2) intravenously every 21 days, or DOX administered during the final 20 minutes of an 80-minute DPPE infusion at 5.3 mg/kg, with both treatments reaching a total DOX dose of 450 mg/m(2). Patients treated with DPPE received intensive premedication to reduce toxicity. The study evaluated progression-free survival (PFS), response rate (RR), response duration (RD), quality of life (QOL), toxicity, and overall survival (OS) as its endpoints. A preplanned interim analysis did not reveal a RR difference exceeding 5%. As a result, new patient enrollment was halted, and all DPPE usage was stopped. The final analysis proceeded as planned after observing 256 progression events, with a median follow-up period of 20.5 months. The comparison between the treatment groups showed no notable difference in RR, RD, or PFS. DPPE combined with DOX demonstrated statistically better results in OS compared to DOX alone (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.91; P =.021). The combination of DPPE with DOX resulted in increased gastrointestinal and CNS side effects. There was no consistent impact on QOL observed.

In several trials, including our recent publication, low-level laser therapy (LLLT) demonstrated some preventive and healing effects against clinically observed objective assessments of OM. However, there is limited evidence concerning LLLT's impact on a patient's subjective perception of OM and QOL. Therefore, we conducted this study to assess how LLLT affects patient-reported outcomes of OM and QOL among head and neck cancer (HNC) patients undergoing CRT. This triple-blind study involved randomizing 220 HNC patients set for CRT (three weekly Cisplatin + RT = 66 Gray (2 Gy/session), five fractions/week for 6.5 weeks, totaling 33 fractions) into two groups: laser (110) and placebo (110). The laser group underwent LLLT (Technomed Electronics Advanced Laser Therapy 1000, He-Ne, \u03bb = 632.8 nm, power density = 24 mW/cm\u00b2, dosage = 3.0 J per point, total dose/session = 36-40 J, spot size 1 cm\u00b2, irradiation time/point 125 s) before each radiation session, while the placebo group did not receive laser treatment. The methodology mirrored our previously published study (Gautam et al. Radiother Oncol 104:349-354, 2012). In this portion of our study, a blinded evaluator gathered subjective outcomes of the patient's reported measures of OM using the Oral Mucositis Weekly Questionnaire-Head and Neck (OMWQ-HN) and QOL through the Functional Assessment of Cancer Treatment-Head and Neck (FACT-HN) Questionnaire. Data were examined using repeated measures ANOVA via a general linear model, with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. The analysis of results indicated that the OMWQ-HN (F = 12.199, df = 6,1314, p < 0.001) and FACT-HN (p < 0.05) scores were notably lower in patients receiving LLLT compared to those in the placebo group. Furthermore, a substantial decline (p < 0.001) was noticed in the occurrence of severe OM, the necessity for opioid pain relief, and total parenteral nutrition.

The CONFIRM trial, a phase III study with a double-blind, parallel-group, and multicenter design, was utilized for this comparison. Participants were randomly allocated to receive either 500 mg of fulvestrant (administered intramuscularly on day 0, followed by 500 mg on days 14 and 28, and subsequently every 28 days) or 250 mg every 28 days. The primary endpoint measured was progression-free survival (PFS), while secondary endpoints included objective response rate, clinical benefit rate (CBR), duration of clinical benefit (DoCB), overall survival (OS), and quality of life (QOL). The PFS was notably extended for patients receiving the 500 mg dose of fulvestrant (362 participants) compared to those on the 250 mg dose (374 participants), with a hazard ratio of 0.80; 95% confidence interval from 0.68 to 0.94; and P-value of .006, reflecting a 20% decrease in the risk of progression. The objective response rates were almost identical for both fulvestrant 500 mg and 250 mg, at 9.1% and 10.2%, respectively. For fulvestrant 500 mg, the CBR was 45.6%, while for fulvestrant 250 mg, it was 39.6%. The duration of clinical benefit and overall survival for the 500 mg group were recorded at 16.6 months and 25.1 months, respectively, whereas the 250 mg group showed DoCB and OS of 13.9 months and 22.8 months. The 500 mg dose of fulvestrant was well tolerated, demonstrating no adverse events linked to the dosage. Quality of life was comparable between the two treatment groups.

Eligible participants had measurable or assessable disease and were required to have an ECOG performance status between 0 and 2; stable brain metastases were permitted. All participants underwent four cycles of cisplatin and etoposide every 3 weeks (step 1; PE). Those exhibiting stable or responsive disease were then randomly assigned either to a period of observation or to receive four cycles of topotecan (1.5 mg/m(2)/d for 5 consecutive days, every 3 weeks; step 2). In total, 402 eligible participants were enrolled in step 1, and 223 eligible participants proceeded to step 2 (observation, n = 111; topotecan, n = 112). Induction with PE resulted in complete and partial response rates of 3% and 32%, respectively. Topotecan treatment exhibited a response rate of 7% (complete response, 2%; partial response, 5%). The median survival duration for all 402 eligible participants was 9.6 months. Progression-free survival (PFS) measured from the date of randomization in step 2 was notably improved with topotecan compared to observation (3.6 months versus 2.3 months; P <.001). Nevertheless, Overall survival from the randomization date in step 2 did not show significant variation between the observation and topotecan groups (8.9 months versus 9.3 months; P =.43).
