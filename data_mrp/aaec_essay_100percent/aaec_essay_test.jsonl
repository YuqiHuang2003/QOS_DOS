{"id": "essay004", "input": "International tourism is now more common than ever before\n\nThe last 50 years have seen a significant increase in the number of tourist traveling worldwide. While some might think the tourism bring large profit for the destination countries, I would contend that this industry has affected the cultural attributes and damaged the natural environment of the tourist destinations.\nFirstly, it is an undeniable fact that tourists from different cultures will probably cause changes to the cultural identity of the tourist destinations. Take Thailand for example, in the Vietnam War, many American soldiers came to Thailand for a break and involved in sexual and drug activities, these huge demands caused many local businesses opened and expanded, even illegally involved in under-age prostitutes to maximize their profits. This was due to the lack of adequate controls by authorities and lead to a bad image of Thailand tourism. Therefore this proves that international tourism can create negative impacts on the destination countries.\nSecondly, there are clear evidences that tourism increasingly create harms to the natural habitats of the destination appeals. As the Australia’s Great Barrier Reef has shown, the billion visitors per annum has generated immense destruction to this nature wonder, namely breaking the corals caused by walking or throwing boat’s anchors, dropping fuel and other sorts of pollutions. For this reason, many marine lives have been endangered, in the extremes part of the reef become uninhabitable for these marine species. Thus, it is apparent that tourism has threatened the nature environments.\nTo conclude, I strongly believe that the tourism has created threatening pressure on both the sociocultural and natural environments. If authorities do not take steps to appropriately conserve these precious values, they will be destroyed in the near future.", "framework": "synthetic", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 179, "to": 239}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 262, "to": 376}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 417, "to": 530}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 532, "to": 818}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 820, "to": 924}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 953, "to": 1031}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1074, "to": 1158}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1160, "to": 1413}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1432, "to": 1550}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1578, "to": 1624}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 1663, "to": 1758}]}], "edges": [{"source": 5, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 5, 9, 10]}

While some students study and live overseas to achieve this, some prefer to study home because of the difficulties of living and studying overseas. In my opinion, one who studies overseas will gain many skills throughout this experience for several reasons.\nFirst, studying at an overseas university gives individuals the opportunity to improve social skills by interacting and communicating with students from different origins and cultures. Compared to the peers studying in the home country, it will be more likely for the one who is living overseas to be successful in adapting himself/herself into new environments and situations in life.\nSecond, living and studying overseas is an irreplaceable experience when it comes to learn standing on your own feet. One who is living overseas will of course struggle with loneliness, living away from family and friends but those difficulties will turn into valuable experiences in the following steps of life. Moreover, the one will learn living without depending on anyone else.\nAlso, employers are mostly looking for people who have international and language skills. Becoming successful in this study will give the student an edge in job market. Therefore, one who has studied and lived overseas will become more eligible for the job than his/her peers.\nIn conclusion, there are many difficulties a student might face when studying and living overseas.

{"id": "essay006", "input": "Studies abroad and the cultural aspect of the experience\n\nStudying abroad is one very common thing that students do, and they have different reasons for that. I believe that studying abroad has many advantages. Students gain a lot out of the experience personally, academically, and culturally.\nFirst of all, students who study outside their countries can get a lot of experience living in a foreign country. Living in a new country requires a great amount of flexibility and adaptability in one's character. For example, students might face many challenges in the host country. Therefore, they should be able to deal with the obstacles that they may encounter. Overcoming problems teaches the students how to be more mature and self-independence. \nOne other important factor is the new academic experience that the students can obtain at the institution where they are pursuing their studies. For example, they will get exposed to a different educational system. They will meet new professors and new classmates which makes the academic experience different from that in their home country.\nMost important is the cultural aspect of the experience. While living in a foreign country, students can learn a lot about the culture of that country. Furthermore, they can meet different people of the country. They can learn about their way of thinking, their customs and traditions, and way of life. Learning about others' cultures is so important. It contributes in building a new understanding in us of how we see the world. It makes us more open, and willing to accept different ideas and thoughts. Also it educates us about the world we are living in. \nIn conclusion, studying abroad does not only have advantages, but also can change us in a very positive way.

The most effective way to convince consumers to purchase a product is through advertising. However, it is not sufficient in itself. The product also should satisfy the needs of the consumers. In my opinion, advertising is the major reason for high sales of a product for several reasons. \nWe are mainly introduced to products through advertisements. Therefore, advertisers push the limits of creativity to dispose the consumers to purchase the product. When the consumers are impressed by the way a product is advertised, they can be convinced to consider that the product is a need in some cases. Recently, there is a very creative advertisements of a soft drink product on TV. The story delivers a desired call to drink that soft drink that people tend to drink when the weather is too hot. As a result of this, the number of that product being sold will increases. \nAlso, the more an advertisement of a product takes place in mass media, the more popular the product becomes. Advertisement is the most effective way to create a well-known product. Consumers tend to purchase the most known product when it comes to picking one out of two different brands of the same product. When a product is commonly used, it becomes trustworthy for the society, no matter what quality it is. However, it also has to be affordable for the consumer. Considering this fact, advertisements have undeniable affects on the society about the product being advertised.

In this essay, I would start by analyzing the factors for higher yields and finish by stating my position on this.\nA raise or a promotion can no doubt increase the morale in the working places. Workers understand they have to work harder to meet the boss' expectations and to make themselves worthwhile. For instance, junior high school teachers have great responsibility not only for students' private lives as they are going through adolescence but also their school work due to the fact that it is an important phase for them to study hard and get into the high school they want. If the teachers receive higher salaries, they will be willing to spend more extra time mentoring the youngsters rather than hoping they learn in cram schools and so forth, as this is what is happening in Taiwan.\nNevertheless, I believe that creating an enjoyable working environment is more realistic and essential if one wishes an increase in productivity and better employee performances. Take Google for example, the company offers recreation rooms and extra personal leaves for their workers to develop a more relaxing and supportive workforce. By doing this, the employers can make sure the employees can actually focus and concentrate on their projects instead of thinking about their children or feeling pressured.\nTo sum up, I believe that a higher pay can be one of the incentive if were to encourage harder-working employees. Alternatively, providing a more secured and relaxing environment for workers can fundamentally boost their productivity since they will be feeling more cared for and therefore do their best for their bosses.\n", "framework": "synthetic", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 346, "to": 423}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 425, "to": 533}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 549, "to": 704}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 726, "to": 812}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 814, "to": 1024}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1055, "to": 1203}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1205, "to": 1361}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1378, "to": 1534}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 1562, "to": 1648}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 1665, "to": 1769}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1776, "to": 1856}]}], "edges": [{"source": 0, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 0, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 5, 8, 9, 10]}

Ever since Charles Babbage (know as \"Father of computers\") invented computers, its development never had a pause. The whole world is dependent on computers, without which, the world will go back hundreds of years.\nIn the modern world, computers are used everywhere. Right from flying planes to sending a small document, computers are needed. They are used in space programs, wars, hospitals, schools and so on. Computers have made human life more easy, convenient and lightning fast. For example, in earlier days, if one had to send a message to someone in other country, it used to take months. But today, it can be sent in few minutes by typing a email and few clicks. Computers provide speed, increase efficiency, accuracy, precision, help to increase productivity and other countless benefits are provided by it.\nMoreover, future prospects of computers are very bright. From a computer as big as a room, it has now been minimized to the size of a palm. Nanotechnology is working to make computers to the order of microscopic levels. Research on making computerized drone soldiers (unmanned computer controlled) is going on. There is no end to the evolution of computers.\nHowever, everything has pros and cons. Computers have made humans over-dependent. Virus programs, privacy breach, leak of confidential documents, cyber attacks, identity theft, frauds etc. are some of its demerits, from a countless list. Computers expose children to vulgar materials. They have even invaded mental health of humans, for example, FAD (Facebook Addiction Disorder - excessive use of social networking website Facebook). Computers have intruded our lives to the effect that a satellite can peep into our homes and privates lives. The recent case of Wikileaks, leaking confidential data is an example of how computers are harmful.\nNevertheless, with all the mentioned demerits, computers have provided security and sophistication too.

The latter one is of particular importance because nowadays more and more people are suffer from obesity. Many studies has points out that numbers of overweight people have increased in developed countries in recent years, which mainly results from insufficient exercises.\nSports activities can improve mental health as well. When people exercise, the neuron cells in the brain release a chemical compound named Dopamine. This hormone can delight one's mind, creating positive feelings. Thus good exercises can often successfully alleviating one's heavy burdens. Moreover, rigorous exercise can also hone one's will, which enable people to be able to tackle stringent problems and arduous tasks.\nIn a nutshell, many activities can let humans relax.

From all of these, it is easy to see why the idea that advertising is a positive part of life will garner strong support.\nHowever, it can be seen that some people have argued against advertising due to its negative impacts. Firstly, a huge amount of different advertisements could be sent automatically by a system to personal phones or email addresses, this is generally known as spam, and causes discomfort or even annoyance to many people. Secondly, advertising can be very expensive and not every advertising campaign can be done successfully and brings good results.

{"id": "essay091", "input": "A single international language or not?\n\nThe 21st century has witnessed the sweeping trends of globalization, which raises people's concerns about whether a single international language should be a necessity or not. From my perspective, a universal language playing the dominant role in the international community is of vital significance to global people.\nIt is especially true if we consider the fact that a single international language plays a pivotal role in global economic cooperation. As businessmen from different countries have access to the same language, they can communicate with each other more efficiently and deeply on trade, which can intensify the transnational cooperation. In contrast, without the availability of the same language, there might be a chance that misunderstanding and conflicts would ensue over business negotiations, impeding collaborations between them. Therefore, a single international language serves an economic purpose.\nAlso, a universal language is an integral part of cultural communication and interactions. If people are equipped with a single international language, they can tell each other smoothly about their countries' specific cultures such as the traditional customs or the modern lifestyles, which enables people to expand their outlooks, viewing the world in new angles. For example, when people travel to foreign countries, the local people can introduce the tourist attractions to such people with the command of the universal language, helping foreign visitors have an enjoyable exotic experience.\nIn spite of this, the disadvantages of the promotion of a universal language cannot be denied. To be more specific, a single international language may, to some extent, erode the cultural identity of a nation. This is because people may be impressed by the cultural values brought with the universal language, eroding a sense of national belong. For instance, some Asians are seeking individualism, previously denied by many Asian countries, due to the fact that they have gradually identified with such values expressed in American movies, which are imported by the governments as a result of the proliferation of English.\nTherefore, I would conclude that a single international language contributes to global community in terms of economic and cultural communication. On the other hand, every country should by no means disregard the preservation of their own cultural heritage.\n", "framework": "synthetic", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 238, "to": 357}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 410, "to": 493}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 495, "to": 693}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 708, "to": 891}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 904, "to": 962}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 970, "to": 1053}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1055, "to": 1327}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1342, "to": 1557}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1675, "to": 1767}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1785, "to": 1903}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1919, "to": 1999}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 2022, "to": 2181}]}, {"id": 12, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 2216, "to": 2327}]}, {"id": 13, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 2348, "to": 2438}]}], "edges": [{"source": 4, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 4, 5, 8, 12, 13]}
{"id": "essay097", "input": "Roles of international sports events\n\nWhenever an international sporting occasion like the football World Cup takes place, it attracts millions of people all over the world. As sport has become a common passion which passed over every national border, popular sports events can help reduce international tensions remarkably and promote national prides safely.\nFirst and foremost, sports events are good chances for excellent athletes to meet and learn valuable experiences from one another so that they can improve their results, break records and bring victories to their own countries. Because a large number of people will gather in the host city for sport events, there are many good opportunities for discovering different cultures. Consequently, sport events with the spirit of healthiness, honesty and fairness can help strengthen understanding, friendship and solidarity among nations. After sharing competitive but interesting moments in each competition, the competitors often shake hands friendly and congratulate the winners, which can lead to an improvement in the relationships among nations.\nSecondly, sporting occasions play an essential role in raising patriotic emotions in both athletes and spectators. Seeing national flags be honored may be the most emotional moments to each athlete. The athlete also seems to be more aware of his responsibilities and he wants to contribute more to his beloved country. When witnessing our national flags flying proudly among others, many of us can stop hiding our pride and happiness. For instance, when Vietnam became the champion of SEAGAMES for the first time in 2008, a festival atmosphere permeated into the streets. People from all ages turned out to the streets with flags, banners and they sang aloud songs of Ho Chi Minh President. The eager atmosphere lasted many next days. In fact, some hooligans were so excited that they took part in motor racing or using fireworks illegally. However, the hooligans only took a minority of people. Therefore, it can be said that sport events help to wake up love and responsibilities strongly in each citizen.\nIn conclusion, international sporting occasions are not only one of the effective solutions to tensions among nations but also a stimulant for releasing patriotic emotions safely. Hence, I recommend that big sports events should be held more frequently in the future.\n", "framework": "synthetic", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 252, "to": 358}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 380, "to": 489}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 498, "to": 586}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 596, "to": 666}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 668, "to": 736}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 752, "to": 892}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 894, "to": 1105}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1117, "to": 1220}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1222, "to": 1304}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1306, "to": 1424}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1426, "to": 1540}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1556, "to": 1677}]}, {"id": 12, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1679, "to": 1796}]}, {"id": 13, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1798, "to": 1840}]}, {"id": 14, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1851, "to": 1946}]}, {"id": 15, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1957, "to": 2001}]}, {"id": 16, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 2034, "to": 2113}]}, {"id": 17, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 2130, "to": 2293}]}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 10, "target": 14, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 14, "target": 15, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 16, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 16, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 16, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 16, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 2, 5, 16, 17]}
{"id": "essay098", "input": "Children engagement in paid work\n\nIn many countries, children are educated from their young age to be independent and responsible for their actions. Their parents allow them to take some jobs because these jobs can help them learn and take responsibilities. However, some people think it's not a good educational measure. From my point of view, the benefits of children engagement in paid work outweigh its drawbacks.\nFirst of all, children can learn about the hardship of earning money. When they take some kind of paid work such as looking after babies, doing housework and keeping shops, they will have some life experience and skills which make them mature and can deal with many different situations in real life. Therefore, they are likely to understand their parents' hardship, to respect values of money and to form a good habit of saving.\nSecondly, when children take jobs, they tend to be more responsible because whether they can earn money or not will depend on their effectiveness and attitudes in working. To keep their jobs, children will have to try their best to finish their duties. For example, if a child works as a shop assistant, he will have to keep an eye on good and products, calculate prices correctly and take responsibilities for any lost.\nSome people may argue that children will be more material, neglect their study for earning money or be exploited by the employers. However, if children get good care and instructions from their parents, they can take advantages of the work to learn valuable things and avoid going in a wrong way.\nIn conclusion, if children take part in some kind of paid work with their parents' permission, they can learn lively lessons and become mature and responsible. I recommend that parents should help their children to choose a suitable job which does not affect their children 's study and that the government should have right policies to avoid exploiting children's labour.\n", "framework": "synthetic", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 345, "to": 416}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 432, "to": 486}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 488, "to": 717}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 730, "to": 846}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 858, "to": 914}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 924, "to": 1018}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1020, "to": 1099}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1114, "to": 1267}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1296, "to": 1398}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1409, "to": 1564}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 1581, "to": 1724}]}], "edges": [{"source": 3, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 3, 4, 8, 10]}

Common belief that a jury should obtain all information regarding a suspect has fostered some lawyers to protest against the current rules in those two countries.\nMany people hold the opinion that past behaviour determines the future actions, which could be the main reason to support the idea of revealing the record to the jury. We must acknowledge that complete data concerning the history of a sued person creates more opportunity for jury members to build an overall picture of defendant's personality. Furthermore, past record might be useful to decide whether a person was able to perform a certain type of crime when it concerns serious crimes, such as kidnapping or a murder.\nNevertheless, in order for the jury to come up with an objective decision not depending on the past experience, the court should provide with details relevant to a particular case only. For instance, a defendant with number of past crimes has more chance to be found guilty compared to a person with no or lighter criminal record. Innocent suspects, eventually, can face unfair juridical decision and pay twice for their previous inadequate actions.\nIn conclusion, I am skeptical about disclosing the defendant's history to the jury, with intention to avoid subjective and probable inaccurate verdict. Thus, I strongly support the current laws of Great Britain and Australia, and would not change the regulations on keeping the jury unaware of past actions.\n", "framework": "synthetic", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 358, "to": 402}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 517, "to": 667}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 682, "to": 844}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 860, "to": 1030}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1046, "to": 1175}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1177, "to": 1294}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1311, "to": 1446}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 1454, "to": 1602}]}], "edges": [{"source": 0, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 0, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 3, 6, 7]}
{"id": "essay104", "input": "The Internet is an adequate source of academic information\n\nOver the past few decades, the world has witnessed a long stride in technological modernization, especially in field of education. This has enabled university lecturers to post their lessons on the web for the sake of students. Consequently, direct interactions between teachers and learners have been deemphasized. However, the impact of the Internet on schooling is still an intriguing issue which has sparked a heated debate among educationists. Personally, I believe that the Internet will pave way for a more accessible and convenient learning.\nFirst and foremost, the Internet is an adequate source of academic information, which will potentially fulfill the needs of university pupils. Nowadays, not only are lectures available online, it is also applicable to find reference e-books as well as multi-aspect documents on the cyberspace. As such, the Internet has grown to become the largest virtual library ever. Moreover, with the use of the Internet, distance and time seem to be no more a hindrance. College students can save their time browsing for necessary information through the web instead of spending hours wandering in bookstores or libraries. Last but not least, the Internet offers a more effective and practical method of studying. While virtual flowcharts and animations may simplify complicated scientific processes, Google and Wikipedia are always accessible for detailed responses to every query.\nIn the near future, the Internet will become an indispensable part in academic training, for the enormous benefits that it brings about. Have you ever imagined what it would be like to stay at home and attend a lecture by a famous speaker in Finland simultaneously? This fairy tale turns out to be true thanks to technical and internet advances.\nCritics may argue that the Internet have several drawbacks which can affect the education system negatively, for instance internet abuse and black webs. However, we should bear in mind that these problems are mainly triggered by students' wrong approach towards the Internet not the Internet itself. Thus, what we are to do is a change in learners' attitude not an elimination of the Internet from academic study.\nAfter analyzing both points of view, I would like to reiterate the necessity of the Internet in learning process. It is obvious that the benefits of the Internet undoubtedly outweigh its disadvantages. However, it is not just the matter of help or hindrance, it is the way you use the cyberspace.

{"id": "essay108", "input": "Early retirement for 55+ employees to help younger people\n\nNowadays the discussion about whether the businesses are supposed to prescribe the retirement age at fifty-five to offer more job vacancies for younger generation has become a controversy. Some believe that is a perfect attempt to support the young, others claim that this is not the case.\nAdmittedly, encouraging the workers to retire at age of fifty-five to release the positions for younger job seekers has some merits. Firstly, fresh graduates are likely to bring a number of practical and applicable ideas to meet the current needs of the organisation. This is because they have been instilled and imparted the most updated knowledge and skills at universities. Secondly, having a larger proportion of young adults could enhance the working effectiveness and efficiency. Compared with aged staffs, younger employees are often physically stronger and energetic which enables them to carry out heavy workload to meet the deadline.\nHowever, sacrificing the senior members to save the young workers poses several negative influences. From personal level, it fosters a sense of unfairness between the older and younger generations. It is undeniable that every person within the business enterprise has the rights to proceed their work as long as they are capable of doing it, disregard the age and physical capacity. From social perspective, massively forcing the early retirement would be one of financial burden to the local government. For example, sufficient pension payments and regular medical care should be given and arranged for the senior citizens after they have been imposed to terminate their employment permanently.\nIn conclusion, even though the introduction of the early retirement has some benefits, it is convincing that it would generate a sense of discrimination among different age groups and increase the government financial pressure accordingly.\n", "framework": "synthetic", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 361, "to": 480}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 491, "to": 615}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 633, "to": 724}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 736, "to": 833}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 835, "to": 991}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1002, "to": 1092}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1094, "to": 1189}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1213, "to": 1374}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1376, "to": 1496}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1511, "to": 1687}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1716, "to": 1774}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 1798, "to": 1927}]}], "edges": [{"source": 0, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 0, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 5, 10, 11]}
{"id": "essay117", "input": "Can technology alone solve the world's environmental problems?\n\nIt is irrefutable that progress in technology leads to environmental problems. Some individuals are of the opinion that if people live a simple life and do not use the things that technology has brought us then these problems can be solved whereas others opine that only technology can solve these problems. In the following paragraphs, I intend to discuss both viewpoints.\nSome people say that if humans stop using technology and lead a simple way of life then only we can save the environment. They argue that it is the luxuries people use which damages the environment. If people don't use air conditioners, automobiles and other such things that technology has brought us, then naturally there would be less pollution and natural resources like fossil fuels would be saved and all this would save the environment.\nOn the other hand there are people who say that technology alone could save the environment. They opine that now we have come so far ahead in technology that there is no going back. We cannot ask the people of the jet age to go back to the age of the bullock cart.\nThere are a lot of advances going on technology which are helping the environment a lot. One prime example is finding solutions to water problems in developing countries such as Africa. By pressurising sea water to produce vapour jets and filtering them through carbon nano tubes, we can get clean drinking water from sea water - an almost inexhaustible resource. Furthermore, Japan is working to build a working space solar power system by 2030. By drawing on the colossal energy of the sun, it could meet the entire world's electricity requirements indefinitely without nuclear or GHG emissions. If successful, the impact on the world would be monumental. It would mean energy for schools, hospitals, and homes.

Internet and computer also offer a more comprehensive access to knowledge, ranging from visual to aural stimuli, which make learning an ever enjoyable experience, especially for children.\nOn the other hand, critics of this idea maintain that although the educational benefits that the Internet may yield are undeniable, there still remain certain shortcomings. Much information as the Internet may provide, most of the sources are unjustified by experts. As a result, information from those sources is subject to question. Admittedly, the computer can show whether an answer to a particular question is right or wrong but it cannot give as an in-depth explanation as a human teacher can. Through face-to-face communication, teachers can also pinpoint the weaknesses of each student and therefore, adjusting and tailoring his or her teaching methodology to meet the levels or the demands of those students. This is where the computer proves to be incompetent.\nIn short, although both sides have their equally valid arguments, I am inclined to think that although Internet can be a useful tool for education, at no time will the unique role of human teachers be replaced.\n", "framework": "synthetic", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 378, "to": 534}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 536, "to": 722}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 897, "to": 989}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1004, "to": 1057}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1071, "to": 1153}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1158, "to": 1222}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1224, "to": 1440}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1442, "to": 1493}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1598, "to": 1641}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 1643, "to": 1704}]}], "edges": [{"source": 0, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 3, 5, 8, 9]}

However, I still agree that it's better to have one or two close friends than to have a large number of casual acquaintances.\nWe can not deny that being a friend with someone is different from only being acquaintant. First, it's not easy to make friend with anyone. I believe friends are people who have great compatibility with each other. After two years in college I have found sometimes there is more differences between people than similarities, for we are growing in the different families and was educated in various ways. Sometimes acquaintances are just acquaintances. We spend time together but we could never be friend. So, it's much easier to have some casual acquaintances than have some close friends.\nSecond, close friends can easily understand each others feelings. Because of the similarity I talked before, acquaintances probably not able to understand you better than your friends. Moreover, they wouldn't even spare time to consider your feelings. Everyone play the role of acquaintance and friend at the same time. Being friendly is a good way to treat a acquaintance but way not enough for a friend. When my friend is sick, I would not only ask if he is okay like an acquaintance but do my best to make him get well as soon as possible. If my friend is going to the wrong direction in his life trail, I will try my best to pull him back, but not stand and stare like it's not of my business. And I believe my friend will do the same to me. In conclusion, a friend is a person you care about. \nTo me, friends are the most important people in my life second to my family.

{"id": "essay129", "input": "Living in a higher pace is better\n\nThere is a hotly debated issue over whether people have to live at a higher or lower pace, and this topic can also be approached from several different angles due to its complexity. Some people tend to be hurry to complete their tasks, while others seem to prefer the opposite position. After deeply pondering over this issue, I also develop my own perspective. I favor the former; that is, I prefer to live in a higher pace condition. \nThe first and foremost reason lies in the inevitable fact that we need to save time for accomplishing some important tasks, and a fitting example of which can be found in my experience of missing exam. I just failed to participate in the university entrance exam because I thought I had enough time for eating breakfast and transporting to the testing place; while I was stocked in a traffic jam and then missed the first test. Therefore, we can start to agree that we have to be eager in our lives. \nApart from the one I have mentioned above, another equally important aspect is keeping in high pace condition can prevent me from getting lazy. If I can avoid being a sluggish person, I can have a higher probability of fulfilling my dream successfully. For instance, I had spent more time on practicing playing piano so that I won a piano competition, defeating those spending less time on practicing. Hence, from this case we are capable of stating that keeping our pace higher is important. \nAdmittedly, on the other hand, there might be some people proclaiming that with a slower pace can enjoy their lives more because it is not necessary for them to notice the time control or acquire the fame of succeed. However, from my limited understanding, I just doubt the credibility of that saying. I do not think that those people with slower pace losing the piano competition can be really happy. In contrast, it is really joyful for me that I can immerse in the joy of the victory and accomplishment. \nBased on the reasons demonstrated above, I believe that living in a higher pace is better because the advantages of this are qualitatively greater than that of the opposite. In other words, I prefer to live in high pace. It is not to say, of course that other points of view are totally without merit.

Despite the argument of some people that learners can obtain more useful knowledge from teachers than from other sources, I firmly believe that both alternative sources and traditional teaching methods from educators are equally important in children's acquisition of knowledge.\nIt is undeniable that the widespread of alternative sources of knowledge has played an important role in students' acquisition of knowledge. Computers can be programmed to provide an endless numbers of questions in diverse range of fields, and as the students answer these questions, the facts has been learned and reinforced. A case in point is the reading and listening parts of TOEFL iBT exams, as candidates have to answer many questions in a limited period of time. Moreover, when students have some academic problems, they can post those to some websites and receive correct answers from unknown people in faraway places without any costs. Besides, in the past, conducting a research require long hours of searching in library shelves, now all can be done at a click of a button. Thus, technologies are vital in students' learning.\nOn the other hand, schools and university are places in which students gather to be educated and learn from each others as well as formal educators. At schools, students' development has been orchestrated stage by stage, step by step by experienced teachers, and their acquisition of knowledge is guided and backed up in a systematic way. Therefore, formal education approaches are also indispensable. \nTo put it all in a nutshell, I pen out saying that alternative sources information and traditional education systems are equally important in children's development.

If certain species are absent from this system, such kind of balance is likely to be disrupted and other species, including human beings, will come under threat.

Although the increase in life expectancy has some pressure on the Medicare system, I am inclined to believe that the advanced medical care brings with it more benefits than disadvantages.\nThe main advantage of high-tech medical care is that people are better taken care so that they have a good health. They can contribute effectively to the development of the economy because healthy workers can create more productivity. In other words, they do not have to spend more time in health checking or treatment so this saves an amount of time as well as cost.\nIn addition, a community with the elderly who have a good health has a major role to play in a sustainable development of a society. In facts, young people will be happy as their parents, grandparents are healthy. It can be said that the improvement of medical care makes a better life for all people.\nOn the other hand, some people maintain that the increase in life expectancy puts a high pressure on the economic system because more pension have to spend for Medicare instead of investing in other sectors of the economic system.

{"id": "essay149", "input": "The opportunity to receive education from university\n\nThere are many factors that contribute to one's success. However, which factor is the most influential one is open to debate. Some people believe that nowadays the assitance from family is quite a essential factor in one's success. It seems that one can achieve success more easily with the help from his or her family. I agree with this statement. In my opinion, family plays a more important role in helping one to pursuit success. There are a couple of reasons.\nFirst of all, more and more people have the opportunity to receive education from university. Since our parents receive better education than our grandparents did, they can provide more advices and helps in our career. In the past, seldom people have the chance to attend a collage. For example, my grandparents did not get a education even in high school, so when my father had difficulty in solving a problem in his childhood, he had to go to his teacher for help. Things have changed a lot. I grow up in a better condition than my father did. Whenever I have problems, I can always ask my parents for help. They can solve the problem quickly because they have learned quite a lot. \nWhat is more, family members can help us in many other aspects. For example, when I did not know what major to choose when I attend university, my father told a lot about different majors. He shared his own experience with me, which helped me quite a lot. Parents are quite experienced than their child, they can guide them toward the right direction. Besides, parents can told their children as many as they can. What they want is help their child to make a progress.\nIn a word, our parents and other family members can help us a lot in our life.

{"id": "essay154", "input": "Living with a roommate is better than Living alone\n\nMany single people have difficulties deciding whether to live with a roommate or to live alone. Each makes different decisions. Some people choose to live alone for privacy, while others choose to live with a roommate for practical reasons. As far as I am concerned, I prefer to live with a roommate. This is because it saves me money, enables me to socialize, and allows me to get help.\nLiving with a roommate saves me a lot of money. If you have roommates, you can split the rent and utilities among them. This means you can get more for less. For example, last year, I shared a room off-campus with my friend, and we decided to split the rent and heating bills into half: I was able to save about fifty dollars for heating, and two hundred dollars for rent monthly. I was able to save a lot of money by sharing wasted heating and rooms with my friend and splitting the bills.\nApart from saving a lot of money, living with a roommate also enables me to socialize more easily. It is always easier to socialize when you have a lot of people around you. You can invite your roommates' friends over to your room and have fun together. For instance, one night, my roommate, Millan, brought his friends along. Even though his friends and I were total strangers to each other, we quickly got to know each other. We soon found out that everyone loved playing video games. We played a video game called 'Halo' together all night, and became good friends. Living with a roommate made socializing much easier for me.\nFinally, living with a roommate allows me to get help. It often is the case that your roommates have the skills or knowledge you need. When you run into a problem, you can ask your roommates if they can help. Some of them may have something to offer. To illustrate, when my computer mysteriously broke down, I dialed up the manufacturer and asked for help. They failed to give me any useful solutions. To my surprise, one of my roommates noticed my problems and offered to help. He was very good with computers, and he managed to fix the problem quickly.\nIn conclusion, while many people decide to live alone for various reasons, I prefer to live with a roommate, and I always will. This is because it offers me many advantages, such as less spending, more socializing, and more help.

Alternatively I believe that it should taken into consideration the situation and conditions, that forces to a person to be a criminal.\nFirst of all if there will be a fixed punishment for each type of crime then it will lead to increase the crime because the punishment will be clear in the mind of professional criminals and they will not feel fear while committing a crime. Secondly, laws and rules are there for people therefore it is necessary to have a look behind crime for instance \"a women steals feed for her child should be treated same as a women, who steals for her drug addiction\". The person who committed crime first time and the professional criminals should not be imprisoned at same place.\nOn the contrary, fixed punishment will reduce the time taken by judges to give their judgement and it will be effective economically for the Government. Everyone should be treated equally because sometimes we see that a poor person who do not have much money for hiring a good lawyer they get imprisoned even without committing a crime and when they come back to the society they become a professional criminal. Therefore fixed punishment will reduce the space between poor and rich people and everyone will understand the importance of each other.\nTo conclude, Government should decide for punishment case by case basis.

The former offers more excitement and convenience while the latter offers a cleaner, quieter and often friendlier place to live. However, despite the advantages of small town life, I prefer to live in a big city for several reasons.\nOn the one hand, I have always wanted to find a job in a big company which locates in a prosperous city area. To make it convenient, I will absolutely choose a place to live that is not too far from my workplace. What's more I can save plenty of money on transportation if I choose to live in the city.\nOn the other hand, life in a big city will not be so dull as in a small town. You can enjoy modern life and have more access to the advanced facilities. For instance, you can visit museums to learn history, and go to a more equipped library to enjoy reading, or you can go to a sports center for exercising. But a small town may be less developed to satisfy all these kinds of needs.\nFurthermore living in big cities means more exposure to stimulation, like all kinds of information. If one can efficiently acquire the information, then, there might come along more opportunities for him to achieve his goals. For example, there are various advertisements here an there, whether on the leaflets or on the big screen showing things of all sorts in commercial zones. If one is seeking a job right in the city or planing somewhere to travel, or just wants to buy a product in a dependable store, he might refer to what he has seen or heard from the advertisements to make a relatively wise choice. \nThere is also another obvious advantage of living in a big city considering the chance of receiving better education of our offspring. Schools in big cities may receive more funds from whether the local comities or the government, which may make them more equipped with advanced teaching facilities and attract more excellent teachers. Our children thus will have a better chance of pursuing high-quality education which is very important for their future development. \nIn conclusion, if I want to live a more convenient life with more access to modern facilities as well as with more exposure to various opportunities, and have my children receive a better education, a big city is the place to live in.", "framework": "synthetic", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 295, "to": 325}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 364, "to": 455}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 480, "to": 558}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 572, "to": 648}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 669, "to": 726}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 728, "to": 801}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 817, "to": 956}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 962, "to": 1032}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1046, "to": 1132}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1134, "to": 1258}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1273, "to": 1413}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1415, "to": 1643}]}, {"id": 12, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1646, "to": 1779}]}, {"id": 13, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1781, "to": 1980}]}, {"id": 14, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1982, "to": 2113}]}, {"id": 15, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 2131, "to": 2349}]}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 4, 8, 12, 15]}
{"id": "essay169", "input": "The precondition of doing research by professors\n\nNowadays, many professors conduct research while teaching in colleges or universities. Although research could bring funding and latest achievements in the field, the research takes up too much teaching time. As far as I am concerned, professors should spend more time on preparing courses than research.\nTo begin with, it is vital that professors should assist students to acquire knowledge. The professors’ duty is to nurture students, and prepare excellent courses. If professors spend a lot of time on research, he will cut the time on preparing courses is reduced, which may decrease the quality of classes. The reason why people enter a university is that they want to learn cutting-edged technologies. In this way, professors should provide well-preparation courses to convey the state-of-art knowledge for college and university students. Therefore, professors should pay more attention on how to teach students rather than conduct research.\nOn the other hand, if professors are busy in doing research, ignoring preparing appropriate courses for students, it would ruin the reputation of universities. Students are unsatisfied with the unprepared course, and the enrollment of universities may decline. Many students would not choose these kinds of universities to study. In this way, hardly can professors find assistants to help with projects. It is adverse to the whole academic field. Accordingly, spending more time to nurture excellent students is more consequential to professors, rather than research.\nNevertheless, professors could teach students through research and projects. Some students enjoy taking part in some research. Through to use the equipment and invent their own work, they may get more experience in the process of research. For instance, electronic students always invent new machines such as robots, MP3 and remote control car. They can manage the electric theory in practical skills. And some students will be rewarded by investing new inventions. However, only under specific circumstance, when students master all of the systematic knowledge, can they accomplish research. This is requires professors provide high quality courses.

{"id": "essay172", "input": "Apartments vs dormitories at university\n\nMany students prefer to live in the university dormitories while others prefer an apartment in the city. Both options have their advantages and disadvantages. After considering the level of freedom, the studying conditions and the economic factor, if I had to choose, I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community rather than in the university dormitories.\nFirst, an apartment provides a lot more freedom than a dormitory. While in a dormitory you have to obey preset rules, in the apartment you set your own rules. You are free to have visits at any time or to be left alone if you want. An apartment offers more privacy because you can choose to have your own room instead of sharing with another student. This is an important factor because you also get more space than you would in a dormitory.\nSecond, from an economic point of view, people often argue that an apartment is more expensive. This is only partially true, you could rent the extra rooms in the apartment to other people and rent would be a lot cheaper. Transportation is another issue, you have to go to and return from the university everyday. You could choose to use public transportation, a cheaper option, or to have a car. The car is an expensive option, but also offers freedom of schedule and destination.\nLastly, the studying conditions are better in an apartment because you don't have all the noise and distractions that you often have in dormitories. A lot of students often complain about their roommate playing music too loud or bringing friends over at inappropriate times. Since in an apartment you don't have a roommate, you won't have this problem, and as a result you would be able to concentrate better. For the same reason, you won't have a problem if you are the one who wants to play music, bring friends over, or study late at night. You set your own schedules. In the other hand, living in a dormitory, and being surrounded by students also has some advantages, like being able to get help with any academic issues from them. \nTo conclude, both options have their advantages, but personally I think the advantages of living in an apartment outshine those of living in a dormitory.", "framework": "synthetic", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 309, "to": 406}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 415, "to": 472}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 474, "to": 565}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 567, "to": 638}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 640, "to": 672}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 681, "to": 757}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 795, "to": 848}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 914, "to": 944}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 975, "to": 1070}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1072, "to": 1162}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1164, "to": 1245}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1247, "to": 1330}]}, {"id": 12, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1340, "to": 1390}]}, {"id": 13, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1399, "to": 1479}]}, {"id": 14, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1481, "to": 1605}]}, {"id": 15, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1613, "to": 1654}]}, {"id": 16, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1656, "to": 1683}]}, {"id": 17, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1701, "to": 1740}]}, {"id": 18, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1763, "to": 1874}]}, {"id": 19, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1876, "to": 1902}]}, {"id": 20, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1923, "to": 2067}]}, {"id": 21, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 2142, "to": 2222}]}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 7, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 18, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 19, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 20, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 16, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 17, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 7, 12, 21]}
{"id": "essay180", "input": "Why are groups or organizations important to people?\n\nDuring our life, it is inevitable that we may be related with any groups or organizations; therefore, groups and organizations are an important part of their lives. In my point of view, groups provide a place for people to gain experiences or achieve goals. My reasons include the following:\nIn the first place, humans are a part of the society, and the society includes a wide variety of groups. Most of all, the groups play an essential role in the process of socialization, from children to adults. We begin taking part in groups or organizations during the early days of life, and especially most people continue their social participation in all through life. By making teamwork, the children in schools may learn to how to get along with others. As university students, it is likely for them to join student organization of their major in order to expand their experiences or communicate with others. After graduating from schools, employees might go to business associations for various business resources and benefits. Thus, almost of us live in the environment of groups.\nBy participating in an organization, it is a positive way for people to obtain some experiences on a particular purpose. A solid group can be a suited environment, which provides people to improve themselves or broaden their horizons. For example, as a student majoring in mass media, I have taken part in mass media student group for a year. When being in the department of art, I have not only learned how to do a project, but also known some famous artists during the term. Above all, it is advantage which increase an opportunity on my resume for the sake of getting a better job.\nFurthermore, groups and organizations would lead people to take action or achieve their goal. Here is an example: there are various charities in the world. Tzu Chi, a non-profit Buddhism organization in Taiwan, is famous for contributing to the social and community services, and medical care. They bring hopes and inspire others with their generous spirit. For accomplishing their missions, the charity should gather people who are volunteers and sponsors for those difficult tasks. As a result, they lit the light for the poor and victims; in addition, they could have chance to help the people in need from all over the world. \nFor the above reasons and examples, it could be widely thought that groups or organizations are a vital part for us in plenty of aspects in different ages and in different backgrounds.", "framework": "synthetic", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 240, "to": 310}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 366, "to": 449}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 464, "to": 554}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 556, "to": 717}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 719, "to": 804}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 806, "to": 959}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 961, "to": 1079}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1087, "to": 1133}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1135, "to": 1254}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1256, "to": 1368}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1383, "to": 1476}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1478, "to": 1610}]}, {"id": 12, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1623, "to": 1718}]}, {"id": 13, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1733, "to": 1812}]}, {"id": 14, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1834, "to": 1874}]}, {"id": 15, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1876, "to": 2012}]}, {"id": 16, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 2014, "to": 2076}]}, {"id": 17, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 2078, "to": 2202}]}, {"id": 18, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 2217, "to": 2260}]}, {"id": 19, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 2275, "to": 2348}]}, {"id": 20, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 2419, "to": 2534}]}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 13, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 13, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 13, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 13, "target": 18, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 19, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 2, 7, 8, 13, 20]}

In other words, he is not jumping into the foreign country. Therefore he can set aside enough time and energy dedicated to learning the language. Besides, all the learners are probably from the same country, so all these people most likely have learned the language, more or less, in the same way.\nOn the other hand, when a new learner wants to learn a new language in the country in which it is spoken, he has the opportunity to communicate with natives. He may find native friends and may participate in groups where members are people from the foreign country. No doubt, it leads to better understanding of language essential skills. He also has access to the most up-to-date language. Thus he can learn most useful idioms, proverbs and so many other things which the former person, person 'A', does not have access to.\nOn the whole, if I wanted to learn a new language and had enough money to afford the travel, I would definitely make the second choice. There are lots of evidences show that communication is the most important factor in learning a new language.

In fact, in this case it is more likely that interests and preferences are the same.\nAnother reason is that a large number of friends can help you to consider all the possible solutions to a problem and to make you more open-minded. For example, if you happen to face a problem and ask them for advice, your friends you will see that issue from their different point of views and accordingly they will help you to consider better all advantages and disadvantages.\nWhen you have just few close friends, on one hand you develop a more intimate relationship with them and you feel you can trust them more, but on the other hand they often will give you viewpoints not so different from yours, adding less to your experience.\nIn sum, although each choice - few close friends or a large number of friends - presents its advantages and its weak points, I think that spending time with a large number of friends can add more to one's life.", "framework": "synthetic", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 257, "to": 315}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 384, "to": 498}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 514, "to": 759}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 773, "to": 897}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 899, "to": 1011}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1022, "to": 1096}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1121, "to": 1244}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1259, "to": 1475}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1477, "to": 1614}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1638, "to": 1733}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 1873, "to": 1944}]}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 3, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 10]}

{"id": "essay202", "input": "Some important characteristics of a co-worker\n\nAt work, you meet people with diverse backgrounds and you are required to maintain sound relationships with many of them in order to have a pleasant work environment. However, the relationship you need to maintain with your co-worker is the most important one since he or she is the person who works very closely with you, and in most instances you have to rely on him or her. Therefore in my view, a good co-worker needs to have three most important characteristics such as cooperation, trustworthiness, and fellowship.\nThe co-workers should be cooperative with one another. If they do not cooperate, there will be lots of disputes. I once had a co-worker who was too family conscious. Therefore he always left office sharp on time without giving any consideration whether the work has been finished or not. Most of the time, I had to do his work in order to protect him from getting caught to the supervisor who was a very authoritative person. However, one day I wanted to be off early because I had to take my mother to the doctor. When I requested my co-worker to give a helping hand to finish my work early, he turned down my request giving a silly excuse. From that day onwards I did not offer him any support and finally he was transferred from our department to a distant location as a punishment for his irresponsibility. Therefore, I believe if the co-workers do not corporate with each other that would be devastating in a work environment.\nThe co-workers need to trust each other. They should not act on suspicion. This is a very important aspect in the work environment. I came across a situation once such that one of my subordinates used to suspect his co-worker for carrying tales to me. To a certain extent his suspicion was valid as his co-worker made several attempts to highlight the drawbacks of him. However I never encourage tale carriers as a principle and therefore his co-worker gave up talking ill against him with me. But this mistrust continued and created very unpleasant situations for everybody in my department. \nFinally, the co-workers should believe in fellowship. This helps them to enjoy their work life while building up very strong personal relationships. After all, you spend most of your day at office.

Although, online classes have many advantages, for me, I prefer traditional learning classes for several reasons.\nFirst, the participant with the others like classmates or professors is still an important factor in studying. Working in group leads to more discussion and more opinion among the class. Consequently, the discussion class results in expanded children vision and their respect to others roommate's ideas. Unlike the distance learning that children have few opportunities to discuss with their friends.\nSecond, classroom learning provides other activities than studying. During student's free time, they have a number of activities that they can join, such as playing sports, going to lab, or going to library. These activities lead to more interact with their friends. Connection with friends improves their IQ abilities, furthermore, they have a chance to learn about their societies. While the online course keeps the children at their home only.\nLastly, in school, there are professors that guided you during you had a problem or needed an advice. The professor provides good answers to you. They do not mind helping you, and they never leave you alone when you got a problem. In contrast, in distance learning, these aspects of the professor had reduced their important. The professor has been assigned to teach only. Moreover, there will be a long response from the teachers when children ask them a question.\nIn conclusion, traditional learning still has many benefits to the students.

While some people believe that non-academic subjects should be completely removed, I strongly disagree with that.\nTo begin with, from the health point of view, schools should not only deliver academic subjects. If physical education is removed from the syllabus, there will be considerable negative effects on students’ health. For instance, after studying and sitting in the classroom for the whole morning, it is better for students to do some outdoor activities, such as stretching, jogging and playing ball games, in order to improve their learning ability during the afternoon classes. Removing physical classes from school education will not only be harmful to young people’s health, it will also decrease their learning capability.\nIn addition, schools are responsible for developing their students into well-rounded people. It is more important for a person to success in life than to success only academically. Success in life should be the ultimate goal of a student, which requires more than academic knowledge, but also practical life skills such as cooking, good communication skills and teamwork spirit. Thus, school education should not only focus on the academic development of a student as it is much more crucial to teach them how to be independent and live a good life.\nSome people may argue that students can learn practical skills after school hours from their parents. However, I believe that it is not a good idea because most young people would rather watch TV or play computer games after school instead of learning life skills from their parents. Moreover, parents are usually too busy with their daily jobs to teach their children the life skills.\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that non-academic subjects are as essential as academic subjects for a student’s development.

As for me, I would follow the new customs, if I migrated to another country.\nOn one hand, it will be easier for people to assimilate into a new country, if they follow the new customs. When people migrate to a new country, they are likely to suffer the culture shock, because of the difference between two cultures. The custom is just a form of the culture and following the custom is a good way to know more about this culture.

As a result, people understand the culture, and then they adapt to the new country.\nOn the other hand, keeping own customs stably might cause discrimination. When people insist to keep their own customs and refuse to accept the new one, they regard themselves as a special group in the new country. The local people may also regard them as a special group as well and separate them from the main-stream society. One example of this is that the Chinese immigrants in Indonesia in 1969. They formed Chinatown and kept Chinese language and customs in it. While the Indonesians stopped working at 4:00 pm and went home for rest, Chinese immigrants were still working. Although being much richer than local people, they faced the discrimination. Their houses and private cars were buried by local people, because the locals were jealous of Chinese people, who had so much wealth, which should have been theirs. If the Chinese immigrants had followed the local customs and assimilated into Indonesia, they would not have been regards as a group of Chinese and discrimination might have been alleviated.\nAll in all, the immigrants should follow the customs in the new country, which can help them survive from the culture shock sooner, and assimilate to a new culture.", "framework": "synthetic", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 386, "to": 450}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 465, "to": 558}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 560, "to": 689}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 691, "to": 802}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 817, "to": 1027}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1042, "to": 1111}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1132, "to": 1185}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1187, "to": 1326}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1328, "to": 1439}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1441, "to": 1512}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1514, "to": 1579}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1581, "to": 1691}]}, {"id": 12, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1702, "to": 1768}]}, {"id": 13, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1770, "to": 1827}]}, {"id": 14, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1837, "to": 1933}]}, {"id": 15, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1935, "to": 2124}]}, {"id": 16, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 2138, "to": 2197}]}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 13, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 6, 16]}

In my opinion, childhood is the happiest time of a person's life.\nFirst, in childhood most people are happier than in adulthood. They do not have to worry about bills, jobs, how would their life be in the future. They just worry about two things: to have fun, learn and be happy. A child's daily life is school, playing and sleeping. For example, when I was young I just came home from school and then I would took my bike or soccer ball and go out and play with my friends in my neighborhood. Moreover, I did not have to worry about costs and other things, I just had fun and learned. Also, people are most creative when they were children, children imagine new things and games just to have fun and be happy.\nSecond, childhood is the period where people go to school and learn. Therefore, school memories are one of the best memories in a person's life. There you learn, to find your first love, to make new long-lasting friendships and of-course you will have a lot of fun. For example, my father's best moments in his life are in his school years. Moreover, he is still in-touch with some of his classmates and sometimes they get together and share their childhood memories.\nIn other words, childhood is, indeed, the most happiest moments in a person's life.

{"id": "essay220", "input": "Learning to be independent is essential for young adults\n\nLearning to be independent is essential for young adults. However, how early the children leave their parents is a difficult issue. In my point of view, staying with the parents for longer time does more benefits than disadvantages to the young adult. My opinion is based on creating memories with parents, saving money, and taking advice from parents.\nFirst of all, one of the most significant upsides is that the young adult can have more experience with his parents. The young adult has to try to create memories with his dad and mom in the early age. When having a job, it is of low possibilities to work in his hometown. If he lives with his parents for longer time, they have more chances to share the feelings, exercise, and travel together. All memories become priceless treasure as time passes by. Thus, I think undergoing with parents is worthwhile.\nFurthermore, living at home costs less than living outside. Learning to be independent means that the young adult needs to leave home. Therefore, he may have to rent a house and the rental would become a burden for parents. Moreover, another daily expense is also the considerable outgoings. Spending much money may not result in what the parents expect their children to be. In a word, the parents can save money, if their children live with them longer.\nThe third convincing reason is that the young adult needs father and mother's suggestions. When in dilemma, the parents can comfort him and give him a big hand. They are the people who are most familiar with him can give a suitable advice and lead him to the right way. If the parents do not help him immediately, he would have to suffer more pain. Hence, taking advice from parents, the young adult can go through obstacles easily.\nTo sum up, living with parents longer brings about memories with parents, less cost, and advice from parents.

Also, it is a interesting travel location.\nFirst of all, the zoo gives humans new knowledge.

The zoo also let students have a chance to learning biology practically. They are able to observe animals' behaviors and features. Moreover, practical learning help students relax from a boring lecture class. Besides, researchers need the zoo to pick up some examples of animals for their researches because it has diverse species of animals.\nSecondly, the zoo preserves a large number of rare animals and provides them safe habitats. In the zoo, there is not so harmful as a forest. They, fed by zookeepers, do not need to find food themselves. Furthermore, we can do artificial insemenation to maintain nearly extinct wildlife.\nLast but not least, because of all weird, acute, and beautiful animals in the zoo, it can be a great tourist attraction. There are a lot of tourists who seek to see those animals closely. If the zoo has a large number of both national and foreign tourists, it will receive a great deal of money.

It is widely accepted by many people that a mistake will return sometimes terrible result. However, I believe that friendship is more important than mistake by a friend, although mistake is terrible. In this essay, I will present two reasons supporting my opinion. \nFirst of all, a mistake does not last for a long time but a friendship lasts forever. Anybody does not remember mistakes. If someone remembers mistake, he or she has a closed mind. I want to say that mistakes will be forgotten quickly. For example, my friend Lee made a mistake that he broke my precious gift. However, I forgot about it just after two days, and I felt at peace with him. Some people might say I am silly, but I think mistake is more forgettable than friendship. \nSecond, Everybody makes mistake. However, if you end a friendship whenever your friend makes a mistake, there will be no friends around you. I agree if a friend makes very a big mistake, we will need to end a friendship. However, when the mistake friend made was not a big problem, we need to understand friend and forgive it because a friend is a gift of our life.

{"id": "essay234", "input": "Students should be required to take regular standardized tests\n\nThe issue at hand is if the schools should require students to take regular standardized exams. This issue is important because nowadays many people cast doubt on it. However, I believe that standardized tests are valuable option for educational system as long as it would help teachers to know if the students are really getting knowledge.\nFirstly, standardized tests are preferable due to the fact that they help teachers to fairly grade the students. For example some students are not so active on the lessons, cause they are already familiar with the issue. Therefore, exams could be the only way for teachers to see the real abilities of those students. In addition, many teachers rely only on the exam results while grading the class, so the usage of standardized tests is the superior option for them.\nAdditionally, standardized tests can be good chance for students to apply their knowledge on practice. Since, some students may get used to simply rewriting solved problems from the blackboard, so they will never try to solve problems on their own. However, standardized tests offer them such chance. Thus, it is clear that schools should require students to take standardized tests, as long as this option helps to both sides.\nFinally, I think that requirement to take standardized tests is the right choice, since in this case teachers can compare the level of knowledge of different students. In any class there will be students who will show low academic performance, so teachers could work with them more intensively. I support the points of those who say that standardized tests are required over those who don’t because if the teacher would know the level of each student he would fairly share his time to all of them.\nUltimately I feel that schools which obligate their students to take standardized tests are right.

From my point of view, I am in favor the former statement that some tough experiences people met before will be helpful in their life path.\nTo start with, hardship makes people realize how to cherish and compliment the common but wonderful little things happened in their life such as, a shining weather, a delicious breakfast and etc. People who have such nice spirit usually know how to find the true love in their life instead of being seduced by greed as to lose themselves in the end. As a result, experiences of difficulties teach them how to keep a nice mood and have confidence all the time.\nWhat's more, people who experienced lots of difficulties will be calmer when they are in troubles. Because they already have such experiences of overcoming some difficulties, they are conscious of what to do and how to do when fierce crisis happens. Those people are more likely to achieve their ambitions in their career because they are aware of how to lead people to reach success despite what kind of difficulties are getting in their way.\nSo, to sum it up, both not afraid of difficulties and appreciating common but pleasant things in their lives drive me to believe that most tough experiences in people's life path will be a priceless treasure to them.

{"id": "essay243", "input": "E-mail or Voice mail Versus Telephone or face to face\n\nTechnology has been developing so quickly and becoming more perfect every day. Communication nowadays depends on technology pretty much. Voice mail, e-mail, telephone or just traditional way: face-to-face. However, I prefer e-mail due to 3 reasons: convenience, honest expression and fluency in communicating.\nEveryone agrees that e-mail has been a great way of communication. You can talk to others from thousands mile. For instance, if you are in Vietnam and another person is in the US - half of the Earth, no matter how far it is, you can keep contact. We will never have to worry if our mails will be sent to the right address. If the address is wrong, then you will know right away. Moreover, e-mail doesn't take too much time: just a click.\nIn addition, writing e-mail helps people express honestly. Some people think that the face-to-face conversations make them feel stupid. Sometimes, their ideas are not expressed as exactly as they expect. For instance, I want to talk to my friend about a ticklish problem like her behavior, it's hard for me to face her and explain what she should do. Therefore, e-mail will be a good tool to help me speak out. She will just read my e-mail instead of listening to my voice which can make her annoyed. I don't have to worry about any other thing can make my opinion become unpersuasive.\nLast but not least, every communication needs fluency so people can understand each other exactly and remember it for a long time. Voice email or face-to-face conversations sometimes make reserve people feel not very confident. For example, when I face my parents, I can't speak out every idea and express consecutively. They may stop me, speak something against it and that makes me forget what I want to say. Anyone can meet this problem once in any conversation. E-mail helps me arrange my idea perfectly and make it persuasive. \nOn the whole, to compare to all ways of communication, I really think that e-mail is the greatest way for major people to use. Its convenience saves our time.

As for me, I work and study at the university and I don't have spare time during the day. I get home at about midnight and I still need to answer some questions and to solve some routine problems. I might not have time to call a person or to meet with him or her in an appropriate time so for me it is better to leave a voice mail.\nThirdly, when you write an e-mail you have enough time to think carefully about what you are writing and how it would be better to express yourself. For example, you can change the word order or you can choose more appropriate style to sound more polite. When you speak face-to-face you are not as able to control every word as you are when you write an e-mail.\nAnd finally, there is no chance to disturb people by sending them an e-mail.

{"id": "essay252", "input": "Should we require our young children to learn music and art\n\nEvery parents expect their children to be outstanding and successful. In order to achieve this, they start cultivating their children when they are very young. In addition to basic knowledge like language or science, music and art are usually on the must-learn list of the parents. In my opinion, I agree that children should learn music and art in a young age because they do contribute several merits to them. \nFirst, it's very suitable for children to develop senses of music and art when they are young. Children absorb things quickly and they bear exact the ability needed in music and art-imagination. Music and art are not like math or language which has more strict rules. They are more abstract, requiring creativity and imagination to be enriched. Children are privileged to have these abilities because they are given more freedom and their imagination has not yet been killed due to reality circumstances. Even if their performances are just some simple drawings and melodies, music and art still bring out children's joy of flying in imagination.\nSecond, music and art are life-long cultivation worthy of investing. They teach us how to appreciate beauty and express feelings in a creative way. They are essential to our spiritual life. Therefore, even if children are not going to be great musicians or artists, learning music and art is still worthy because it can nourish your temper and serve as a leisure.\nHowever, some people might argue that parents shouldn't put so much stress on children, since learning too many skills seems to be a burden for them. In my opinion, it depends on how you value these learning activities to be like. If parents push their 5 years old child to play piano 8 hours a day just like a professional performer, that might be too much. In a child stage, music and art are more like an open door to introduce the art world than training area to acquire specific skills. In this way, it will not be such pressure on children. \nIn conclusion, young age is the perfect time for children to learn music and art and they are indeed valuable to people not only in their young stage, but in every stage. Music and art can accompany a spirit as long as they are given the chance to enter his/her life.", "framework": "synthetic", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 371, "to": 421}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 430, "to": 471}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 481, "to": 567}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 569, "to": 667}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 669, "to": 740}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 742, "to": 817}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 819, "to": 866}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 875, "to": 977}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 979, "to": 1119}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1129, "to": 1188}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1190, "to": 1267}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1269, "to": 1309}]}, {"id": 12, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1322, "to": 1425}]}, {"id": 13, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1434, "to": 1483}]}, {"id": 14, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1523, "to": 1571}]}, {"id": 15, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1579, "to": 1633}]}, {"id": 16, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1650, "to": 1714}]}, {"id": 17, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1716, "to": 1842}]}, {"id": 18, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1844, "to": 1975}]}, {"id": 19, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1990, "to": 2030}]}, {"id": 20, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 2048, "to": 2113}]}, {"id": 21, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 2118, "to": 2202}]}, {"id": 22, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 2204, "to": 2299}]}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 16, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 14, "target": 19, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 16, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 19, "target": 18, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 12, 14, 20, 21, 22]}
{"id": "essay255", "input": "The car use will definitely decrease in twenty years\n\nViews differ considerably when it comes to the issue of whether cars will be less than there are today in twenty years or not. Some people believe that since the environmental concern has risen, the car use will decrease. While others think that a personal car is important for ones daily life. Both of the opposite arguments appear to be somewhat convincing and stand to reason. But as far as I am concerned, I agree with the idea, which is that there will be a decrease in cars use in the future. The following reasons will present my points.\nFirst of all, since the public transportation has improved, it is much convenience to take a subway or a bus. For example, I live in a city which always have a jam in the morning and doesn't have enough parking lots for the cars. So, with the stations increased people are willing to take a public transportation than drive on their own. \nSecond, a driving car can make a lot of different pollutions to the world. So, with the risen of the aware to the environment, people will think more about whether to drive on their own or not. For example, instead of driving each one's car, if we put forty people in a bus, it will solve the traffic jam by decrease the cars use and also reduce the air pollution for the city.\nAlthough, I am agree with the idea that reducing of the car use will be achieve in twenty years. I think I still have to point out that there are some different points of view. People who hold different opinion may argue that a personal car uses is in need because a public transportation can't meet every place. Of course, it may be true when you want to go to some countryside or some other inconvenience places. However, no matter you are going to somewhere for a trip or you just simply live in some suburbs and so on, it always have some other ways that you can do, you can ride a bike, or even walk on your feet. It not only helps you to reduce the car use, but also good to your health. In this way, this won't be a problem at all.\nIn conclusion, given the reasons described above, when the advantages and disadvantages of whether there will be fewer cars in use in twenty years or not are carefully compared, the best choice is obviously stand on my side, which is that the car use will definitely decrease in twenty years.", "framework": "synthetic", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 501, "to": 551}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 619, "to": 657}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 659, "to": 707}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 722, "to": 827}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 833, "to": 935}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 946, "to": 1011}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1017, "to": 1130}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1145, "to": 1314}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1542, "to": 1572}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1581, "to": 1627}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1640, "to": 1729}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1740, "to": 1933}]}, {"id": 12, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1935, "to": 2008}]}, {"id": 13, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 2023, "to": 2053}]}, {"id": 14, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 2294, "to": 2346}]}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 2, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 13, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 11, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 2, 6, 8, 14]}
{"id": "essay259", "input": "Working at home vs Working in a company\n\nDue to the convenience of current technology, people can do their works everywhere as long as they have the equipment around them. People are no longer restricted in the office. This rapid progress in technology leads to the question whether it's better working at home with a computer and a phone than working at the company's office. In my opinion, I believe that working at home is worse and less efficient than working in the office.\nFirst of all, while working in the office, people can interact with their colleges instantly. They can either get help from colleges or discuss about the work together. Think about the big project that a group is working on, if any group member has new idea about the project, he/she can assemble his/her colleges right away and discuss. It's more efficient and straight-forward than talking in the phone. For another example, if one’s computer or Internet has any breakdown, he/she can call the MIS staff to fix.\nSecond, working at home has many disadvantages that will no doubt lower the efficiency of works. For example, people are easily distracted while working at home. It's hard to concentrate on work if people can grab the TV remote or some junk foods right away. In addition, while people are working at home, there will be no one supervising them, thus raises the chance of loafing. Moreover, people who work at home are more likely to miss the important events happening in the office, like some announcements from the boss.\nIn conclusion, working in the office is obviously better than working at home in terms of efficiency.

{"id": "essay265", "input": "The ability to relate well to people is more important\n\nI think that No factor is important enough by itself to succeed in any situations. We should consider many factors and choose the best of them. I believe that both the ability to relate well to people and studying hard in school are important for success in a future job for following reasons:\nWe need to know and learn about the theoritical basis of our future job. This can be done in school. In school, we are able to identify skills required for our future job and work on mastering and learning them. If we study them hard, we will have the chance of doing our job better and quicker in the future. For example, if someone wants to become a good industrial engineer, he should study his technical courses very well so that he will be able to utilize them well in his future job. As you can see, studying hard in school is an important factor to succeed in a job.\nOne of the other factors for success in a future job is effective commuincation. By relating well to people, we are likely to have a lot of friends and therefore we will have a wide network of communication. Commuincation can bring many benefits. For example, if you need help with getting a job, by commuincating with people offering jobs whom you treat well and therefore they respect you as well, you can achieve your goal. Or, if you are a salesman in a store or any other place, by relating well to your customers, you will increase the chance of their coming back again and becoming your regular customers. So, relating well to people is also another important factor. \nIn sum, though some people may disagree with me, as I explained my reasons and examples above, none of those factors are important and sufficient enough by themselves and we should notice to both of them because each of them has its own benefits.", "framework": "synthetic", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 215, "to": 326}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 350, "to": 421}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 423, "to": 449}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 451, "to": 560}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 562, "to": 658}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 673, "to": 838}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 856, "to": 922}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 924, "to": 1003}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1005, "to": 1071}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1086, "to": 1130}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1132, "to": 1169}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1184, "to": 1283}]}, {"id": 12, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1298, "to": 1349}]}, {"id": 13, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1355, "to": 1535}]}, {"id": 14, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1541, "to": 1597}]}, {"id": 15, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 1771, "to": 1803}]}, {"id": 16, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1812, "to": 1845}]}], "edges": [{"source": 6, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 12, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 14, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 6, 14, 15, 16]}
{"id": "essay266", "input": "The advertising is the main cause of unhealthy eating habits\n\nAdvertising is becoming part of our modern society. They penetrate into people's life, affecting people's choices in different things. Therefore, it comes to the debate whether advertising has positive influences on people's life. Some people say that advertising must be blamed for the unhealthy eating habits, while others believe that there are still some other factors directing people's judgments. In my opinion, the advertising is not the main cause of unhealthy eating habits.\nFirst of all, advertising is not entirely decisive on personal eating habit. The key to forming a healthy eating pattern lies in people's concept of wholesome diets and self-control. It is sure that advertising always makes the products so tempting, regardless of whether they might bring negative effects on the human body. However, advertising is not the only information source for people. People can still acquire different viewpoints about foods from other sources, like news or magazines. As long as people are clear about how to maintain a healthy body and they persistently keep track of their eating habits, they can successfully prevent themselves from those temptations. It will be not persuasive if people just blame the advertising sector of a fast-food company for making them so fat and not reassess their own behaviors. \nSecond, in the era when people are becoming conscious of a healthier lifestyle, some companies are actually aiming at this rising trend and start to promote healthy foods. In other words, advertising may even bring healthier eating habits to the people. Think about the recently popular organic foods that are claimed to grow in an environment without pesticide and those crude foods in which less salt or less sugar are added. These are the main traits that advertising is hitting on and the overall results are good. In these cases, the advertising industry bolsters people's awareness of having a healthy lifestyle. \nIn conclusion, advertising is not the primary reason of unhealthy eating habits. There are the build-up of the concept about healthy eating habits and self-control that really matter. Besides, advertising might lead to healthier eating customs due to the growing awareness of living under a better lifestyle. It is inevitable to be exposed to the environment full of advertisements but it does not mean that our right to choose is taken away.

{"id": "essay277", "input": "Learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives\n\nThere are many debates regarding whether understanding ideas and concepts is more essential than learning facts for students or not. Although multitudes of people think that knowledge of ideas and concepts is more vital for students, I am in the conviction that learning facts has more subsequent advantages for students' future lives. In the following, I will state my reasons for this choice.\nFirst, when students learn facts more in school, they would be ready for facing problems in their own life after their graduations. As a case in point, more information about facts would make students more familiar with the real life other that only their concepts. As a result, they would prepare to encounter their life out of school to solve their problems better. \nSecond, it would improve students' social behavior. If students only rely on concepts and ideas theorically, they would not realize human's mind very well. They should understand objects more that concepts to obtain the ability of analyzing matters well. Thus, if they deal more with facts, they can realize social situations effectively and so improve their social communication in everyday life. \nMoreover, these way students are teached to control their fears and concerns in facing facts. As a matter of fact, when a student understands a fact and its consequences, he or she can encounter it more confidently.

{"id": "essay278", "input": "Financial support for sports and social activities\n\nThere are a lot of debates about the importance of sports and social activities in contrast with the main classes. It is very subjective decision for students to have or not have these facilities. Although multitudes of people think that sports and social activities are not as necessary as academic subjects in colleges, I think that these activities have the same efficient role in students' lives. In the following, I will state my reason for this choice.\nFirst, besides the good body shape, sports have very vital effects on human's healthfulness. In my viewpoint, our body and moral health depend to physical activities directly. As a case in point, last month I had very difficult exam that I forced to study for one week back to back. After that exam, I felt depressed and exhausted. Therefore, I decided to go to gym to recuperate and it responded very well! As a result, sports are necessary for students to acquire their energy and health.\nSecond, besides the academic knowledge, the awareness of social behavior is an important factor for human's life. As a practical epitome, students should be prepared to present in society after their graduation. Thus social activities can help them to be familiar with other's mind and different environment. In my opinion, social groups and classes are significant factors to prepare students to contribute in discussion and encounter real social environment. So, social activities have same rights to receive monetary support.\nMoreover, they bring about students to be happier and to have more fun and entertainments. If we follow just one wing of my life i.e., studying as a student, after some whiles it would be boring and we wouldn't have any motivation. Such activities can help us to pick up with other students and have more friends. In my perspective, more friends and new experience inspire the feeling of happiness and excitement in me.\nAll in all, I am in the conviction that sports and social activities should obtain analogous concern and money in the view of above-mentioned reasons. They bring a lot of advantages and benefits for students and also affect their future in a positive way.", "framework": "synthetic", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 387, "to": 451}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 518, "to": 602}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 621, "to": 685}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 707, "to": 792}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 794, "to": 841}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 854, "to": 917}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 932, "to": 1000}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1010, "to": 1114}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1140, "to": 1212}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1219, "to": 1309}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1326, "to": 1461}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1467, "to": 1529}]}, {"id": 12, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1541, "to": 1620}]}, {"id": 13, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1622, "to": 1761}]}, {"id": 14, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1763, "to": 1843}]}, {"id": 15, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1864, "to": 1949}]}, {"id": 16, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 1991, "to": 2061}]}, {"id": 17, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 2102, "to": 2205}]}], "edges": [{"source": 5, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 6, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 6, 11, 12, 16, 17]}

Many people pursue to study foreign language. There are two options to learn foreign language. First is stay in homeland to study foreign language. The second option is that go to study in another place that foreign language are spoken. Going to another place to learn language is better choice. I will give reasons to support my opinion.\nTo begin with, going to another country to learn language is a good environment to stimulate people to learn language. For example, everyone around me speaks foreign language, and then I have to improve myself to communicate with people. If I could not communicate with other people, I could not even buy food to sacrifice my hunger. This environment makes me want to develop myself to be able to communicate with people that speak foreign language.\nSecondly, having friend that speaks another language is help people to professional in that language faster. For instance, English school in outside my home country, there are many people that come from different places and from different languages. The only language that I could talk to make friends is English language. Thus, I could talk with my friend without worrying about speaking wrong. This reason makes me have a progress in foreign language faster.\nIn conclusion, I personally believe that learning language from foreign country is better than learning language in home country because I have to improve myself to communicate with other people.

{"id": "essay289", "input": "Getting opinions from many sources could augment people's performance.\n\nGetting opinions from many sources could augment people's performance. Thereby, evaluating from students is one of the ways to improve quality of educational system. Not only teachers could amplify their performance but the whole education system are also improve performance from evaluation made by students. Therefore, I agree with this notion that students should be asked to evaluate their teachers.\nTo begin with, Evaluating teachers made by students could improve teachers' performance. For example, evaluation made by students is similar to feedback from customer that business owners need to know in order to improve their product. Students might complain about their teachers spoke too fast that students could not catch up on information. Consequently, teachers could improve themselves by speaking slower to make sure that students could get all information that they want to give. Therefore, evaluating from students could improve teachers' performance.\nAdditionally, this evaluation from students could improve schools' quality. Teachers could augment their quality. Consequently, When school gather teachers that have great performance, school are gaining higher quality. For instance, in many cooperation such as Microsoft that could produce many great products because they have employees whose performance are very high. Schools could produce intellectual students because school have teachers who are always improve their quality from evaluation made by students.\nFinally, people who get the most advantage from evaluation is students. Students could study in class that have teachers who have experienced and greater performance. Because teachers are always adapt the way they teach in order to make students easy to understand their subjects, students could comprehend their subject easily. As a result, students, who study from great schools which have great performance teacher, graduate with great knowledge to survive in next steps of life.\nIn conclusion, I agree with this statement that school should ask students to evaluate their teachers because teachers could improve their performance. Moreover, schools are also improve their quality because they have high performance teachers. Furthermore, students are easy to understand their subjects.

Many people advocate that technology makes their life easier. Although I conceded technology may make people's life complicated in some aspects, the convenience it brings is more. In what follows, I will illustrate my point of view.\nFirst, when it comes to the field of transportation, there is no doubt that the technology in automobile has made people's life simpler. With a private car, you can reach the destination in another city just sitting in the vehicle. Alternatively, if you would like to have a trip across the ocean, a plane can carry you there in only a few hours, which is hard to imagine in the ancient times.\nSecond, technology also makes teaching simpler. In the past, teachers have to write what they want to convey to students on the chalkboard, resulting in a great waste of time and the fatigue of teachers. With the advent of iPads in e-learning, paper books become unnecessary, so does the blackboards, it is because all the knowledge and information are stored in the iPads, with a single click, and they would appear right before your eyes at once.\nAdmittedly, to some extent, technology may make people's life more complicated. For example, the cell phone, which used to be simply a tool to deliver messages to your contacts in a distance, now are playing a role more than just a phone in social communications. For instance, folks have to check their Facebooks, Twitters, and Forums accounts every minute, which add too much pressure to them.

These people play an important role to increase effectiveness of a company. Working fast yet risky has a place near the ideal goal mentioned before. I am totally agrees with the statement for some reasons. Trying to learn skills, working in two places in a week and gaining more tasks are the reasons which take into account as the most important causes of my choice.\nTo begin with, if persons work rapidly, they will have more chance to study. Attending in some classes which try to increase the skills of employees can be considered as an absolutely effective parameter. If people learn how should increase their speed at work by studying, they can stares in their workplace. For example, I have a friend who was working so slowly. He has been threatened by his boss who was going to fire him. My friend went to a course where he learned how should work rapidly and now he is working.\nMost importantly, people prone to work in two or three firms in a week because the expenses have been increased. If they work just in one organization they cannot earn enough money. This fact pushes them to work faster and faster. For example, because applying to study abroad needs a lot of money, I am working in two organization to gain more salary. The more money, the more chances.\nLast but not least, people who work slowly can no longer handle more tasks. If you show in your workplace that you are the one who can work more than other even carelessly, your boss will assign you more tasks. If you do them fast too, the first acknowledgement of your boss encourages you to work harder. It turns you to a person who has skill of working without hesitation. Even if we ignore this result, by the same token, you can get higher position and more money.\nTo sum up, I completely approve of the statement which says people should work faster even more risky. Gaining more skills by study, having more than one job, and handling more tasks are the benefits of it which overweighs its disadvantages.

{"id": "essay331", "input": "The city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity\n\nThe city where I was born used to be of a great antique beauty, which was surrounded with by lots of ancient style buildings. Unfortunately, the unstoppable trend of urbanization makes me only appreciate parts of those classic buildings in the pictures or in museums. In order to prevent the disappearance of the historic buildings, some citizens suggest the government to spend money on historic buildings. As far as I am concerned, we should do our parts to do what ever it takes to protect old buildings, letting next generations still have a chance to look at them. Here are some reasons and examples to illustrate my viewpoint. \nHistoric buildings have intrinsic values, because they are significant symbols of a city. Old buildings are reminders of a city's culture and complexity. By seeing historic buildings -- whether related to something famous or recognizably dramatic, people are able to witness the aesthetic and cultural history of an area. For example, when somebody mentions Beijing, China's capital city, you will immediately have Capital Palace come to appear in your mind, because it is the most remarkable sign of the city, and also it is the inevitable history of Beijing, even the entire China. Depending on the study of Capital Palace, researchers have a comprehensive understanding of the history and the culture. \nFurthermore, historic buildings make our lives more colorful, provide places for citizens to relax bodies and minds. The city is occupied with an abundance of modern houses and and high buildings which make it crowded, and no rooms for people to relax themselves. However, the warmth of the materials, the heart pine, marble, or the old brick, all those old buildings features call back of our inner peace. Lying under the roof of a historic building or sitting on the desk fill with history are both easy ways to forget life's little annoyance and feel peaceful. \nMeanwhile, historic buildings can be a source of maintenance fees. There are many historic buildings, such as Beijing Place, Shanghai Artist Museum, they are all able to support themselves financially by charging tens of thousands of tourists. Our governments will be happy with those efficient consequences, and a majority of cities also can imitate this economical cycle. \nOverall, I believe that the city which I enjoy the most is a combination of history and modernity.

{"id": "essay348", "input": "Paying taxes is enough contribution from citizens\n\nPaying taxes is the obligation of citizens in almost every country. Some people believe that they have made enough contribution to the country by doing that. Personally, I tend to disagree with this view.\nTo start with, all people who are able to work should pay tax to the government, as it is the most important source of government's revenue, which is mainly used to serve all citizens. For example, a large proportion of the tax is spent on national defence and in maintaining social stability, so that every one can work and live in a peaceful environment. The tax is also used to pay the salaries of workers working in public service sectors, such as teachers and police officers. Although these workers do not produce profit directly, what they do is for the well-being of the whole society.\nHowever, I would argue that citizens have other important responsibilities to fulfil apart from paying tax. As we know, there are impoverished or disabled people in every society, needing help and support from others. It is true that the government can provide some fund to ease their difficulties, but such financial help is usually far from enough. In such case, aids from more capable or wealthier citizens are particularly crucial, which are a great complement to government support. Another responsibility all citizens should take is to maintain social stability together with the police force. There are criminals in every society, and the number of policemen the government can hire is limited. So it is quite necessary for the local residents to take actions and ensure the safety of the communities, by doing things like reporting suspicious activities to the police department.\nIn conclusion, it is a significant obligation of citizens to pay tax to the government.

This will be proven by analyzing how computer assists children to use vast resources available over internet to study effectively as well as develop some basic skills which help them in future careers.\nThe best thing about internet is the availability of information in the form of text, image or video related to almost everything and through computer children can access internet to gather knowledge on the subjects they are studying or they are interested about.

Some people believe that foreign language instruction should start in pre-school. However, those who disagree contend that this should be taught in later years. This issue has garnered some attention in the academe as it has an impact on the children's learning. I personally believe that it is important for children to be taught with a secondary language as early as kindergarten.\nTo begin with, children might not be really comfortable with the use of a language other than their native tongue when they are in their kindergarten years. Learning at school must be convenient for them if they speak in a way that they are used to. Moreover, teachers think that foreign language most likely leads to confusion for children who are yet to start learning. Another important thing to consider is that the teacher should be well-trained in the use of this specific language, so quality education will be delivered. \nNevertheless, it is undeniable that kids are amazing learners, and the best time to hone them is in their younger years. The introduction of foreign language will be new to them; however, their curiosity will drive them to learn and comprehend. In this way, grasping a new language will be natural to them. In addition, the positive impact of this strategy is beneficial to both learners and teachers. Teachers will not find it difficult to make students learn such new concept in their teenage years. It is certainly clear that the advantages of early introduction of foreign language outweigh its disadvantages.\nIn conclusion, the use of foreign language instruction as early as kindergarten is supported by some people; however, there are those who disagree.

In the whole world, 51% countries have polished death penalty; even, it is at 98% in Europe. Some people claim that without this punishment our lives would be less secure and crimes of violence would increase. However, others argue that it is not essential to control violence in society by the death penalty. Personally, I think it is no evidence about the reduction of crime rates due to the death penalty because of many reasons.\nFirstly, capital punishment is a form of revenge which creates violent culture. Crimes kill someone which is illegal; nevertheless, the government use law to punish them, which is the same way they sinned but in a legal one. As a fact that the criminal is repeated second time; also, it is regarded as the \"legalized revenge\" to victims' family. Hence, death penalty neither controls the violent in society nor creates a violent culture.\nSecondly, nobody has the right to take another human life. It is undeniable that the rights of life are the basic and vital rights of a human being. No one has the right to take the life of a human; even if he committed murder. If you kill a criminal, you become a criminal. Moreover, if we think that killing is the best way to solve the problem, it is neither unethical nor immoral. In short, crimes seem to increase due to the capital punishment.\nFinally, with some of serious criminals, capital punishment is an easy way out. Criminals should be punished for their misdeeds. If they kill someone and end their life by dead without paying for their sins, it is so easy for them. They do not undergo any pain or misery. Why do not we have other wisely punishments? As we can see some industries such as mining, oil and gas extraction, reclamation, etc, needs many labors. Why do not punish them by doing something meaningful for the country- it is better. Moreover, rehabilitation and education is also a better way in order to prevent or minimize offensive acts. \nTo conclude, capital punishment is a form of legalized revenge, it is an easy way for serious crimes, and nobody has rights to take others life; thus, it neither demines crimes of violence nor be essential to control violence in society.

In high school, for instance, an individual cannot resist studying painstakingly through day and night when the others who are astoundingly ambitious and set sights on prestigious universities around the globe are doing the same. From a psychological perspective, the feeling of being subordinate to their peers exert enormous pressure on the children, which subsequently transforms into some sort of stimulants and boosts the children's academic performances.\nTo add up, when it comes to knowledge and the acquisition of such, classmates are second to none. It is a matter of fact that students share even more time together than with their parents, explaining a great deal of wisdom they absorb from each others; it can be, for example, lessons on the class, social skills or general etiquettes that are sometimes overlooked by parents.

{"id": "essay398", "input": "We can not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject\n\nThere is a view that universities and colleges should equally enroll male and female students in numbers in each faculty. Personally, I do not agree the viewpoint, because many different characters exist between male and female students.\nOn one hand, boys and girls have the diversity in psychological modes and individuality. Most of male students tend to use their left brain to think and act, and they are more rational and logical than girls in many cases. For instance, there are more male scientists and engineers in comparison with females around the world. Many boys are interested in science and technology, while a number of girls like to learn literature, education and arts. Besides, girls are more likely to prefer some jobs related to emotion and communication, such as teacher, singer and interpreter. This means that girls differ from boys in mind and behaviour to a large extent, and they both have better ability in the specific aspect.\nFurthermore, it can have a negative affect on these students to require them to choose a subject in equal proportion of gender, and that does not conform to students' personality traits and mental development. For example, a girl, who is interested in literature, is arranged into an engineering department, but she is unlikely to focus on her subject, and this also can block the girl's future development and career prospect.\nOn the other hand, universities should encourage more girls to choose science subjects and more boys to study the humanities, and this could avoid imbalance of gender in some subjects. It would affect students' mental health to study in the environment of single gender.\nIn conclusion, it is necessary for universities to respect the individual choice of subject due to the diversity of boys and girls, and we ca not forcedly put the same numbers of males and females into every subject.", "framework": "synthetic", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 254, "to": 318}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 333, "to": 407}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 409, "to": 541}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 557, "to": 645}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 647, "to": 767}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 778, "to": 897}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 915, "to": 1035}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1050, "to": 1163}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1169, "to": 1245}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1260, "to": 1343}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1349, "to": 1388}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1394, "to": 1463}]}, {"id": 12, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1484, "to": 1589}]}, {"id": 13, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1595, "to": 1648}]}, {"id": 14, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1650, "to": 1734}]}, {"id": 15, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 1751, "to": 1951}]}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 1, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 7, 12, 15]}
