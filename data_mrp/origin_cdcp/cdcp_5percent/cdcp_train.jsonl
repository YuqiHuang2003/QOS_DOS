Disputability of any amount over the amount at the moment of default would instantly get both the credit card companies and the debt collectors working with the consumer on a reasonable plan going forward, no? As it stands now, credit card companies can and usually do jump the interest rate up to as high as 29.9% and may even let the account stay in default  as they rack up frequent default points on the debtor. When I gave up my regional emmy award winning video business to become a caregiver for both of my parents, eventually savings ran out and I notified each of my credit card vendors ahead of any default. NONE could offer me anything other than, \"pay your bill on time\". If instead the credit card companies know that once the default occurs they cannot accrue any more penalties, fees or interest rate charges on the debt, they will bend over backwards to work with the alleged defaulter to get them to pay down the debt. Citibank rate jacked my never late payment 15 year old credit card account by 5,000 dollars. I dispute that amount of excess in lieu of why I had to default, but Citibank does not care, nor does the debt collector. The amount of the debt reverted to what it was at the time of the default, you can bet citibank would be working hard to work with me.", "framework": "cdcp", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~jpark/", "source": "https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~jpark/", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "CDCP_policy", "anchors": [{"from": 0, "to": 127}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 128, "to": 337}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "CDCP_fact", "anchors": [{"from": 338, "to": 442}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 443, "to": 488}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 489, "to": 543}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 544, "to": 745}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 746, "to": 811}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 812, "to": 1063}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 1064, "to": 1156}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 1157, "to": 1278}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 1279, "to": 1413}]}], "edges": [{"source": 0, "target": 1, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 3, "target": 4, "label": "CDCP_reason"}], "tops": [0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]}
