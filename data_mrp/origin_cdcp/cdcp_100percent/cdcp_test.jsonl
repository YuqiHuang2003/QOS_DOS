Involuntary defaults should allow the debtor to have the debt reset to where it was at the time of the default minus any payments made.

{"id": "00389", "input": "Having gone through a Chapter 7 bankruptcy I can tell you that debt collector phone calls were the worst part of the bankruptcy experience. Massachusetts has it right limiting the number of calls debt collectors can make. That would remove one of the favorite illegal tactics debt collectors use to harass debtors. Some debt collectors would threaten to put us on robocalls so that our phone rang hourly until we agreed to a repayment loan schedule. Or they would threaten to call my spouse at work to see if he would be \"more cooperative\" and agree to a loan repayment schedule even after being informed that his workplace did not allow debt collection calls. Nothing phased these people  and they appeared to enjoy verbally abusing me. Informing them that we wanted all debt collection to be written was also ignored. I could accurately predict who was calling by the day and time of the calls. Chase Bank called every Tuesday morning at 9AM. Bank of America called every Monday morning at 10:30AM. These calls were always professional and appreciated. I followed specific instructions given by our bankruptcy attorney who did not want the debt collectors to know that we were planning on filing bankruptcy in a few months. So I faithfully answered every single debt collector call for almost six months. I politely confirmed my identity. I confirmed I owed the debt  and then I politely told each call that I could not start to repay the debt at this time. The banks/credit cards accepted this without a problem and remained professional. Others like GE Capital and the vacation time share debt collectors would then start with the abusive comments. Calling me a \"deadbeat\" and swearing at me was popular. Another popular threat was how they would harass us nonstop until they got their money. What finally put a stop to the unethical tactics was when they would call and inform me that I was being taped I then informed them that I too was now taping their phone calls. Most immediately hung up. A few would clean up their act and then act in a professional manner. The ability to tape debt collection calls is a powerful tool for the debtor to have and I would encourage this agency to grant debtors this right.

But I can not accept \"in writing\" to mean messages and communication sent via social media. I think that E-Sign consent should only be valid for the original creditor. And any and every collector who then gets involved must get the debtor to consent E-Sign with them. The reason is because there are some things that I, as a consumer, am comfortable with dealing online or through email with my original creditors, but there are things that I know I would not feel comfortable dealing with online/email with a debt collector.

As I have explained in another post here, I live in a fairly large metro area, and whenever anyone with my very common last name and first initial skips town without paying his/her bills, I'm the one who gets the calls from the debt collectors. I know that a call about \"an important business matter,\" is a call about a debt. I have received many of these kinds of calls. Whenever a debt collector calls me and leaves a message without a name, it doesn't take me very long to figure out that the call is from a debt collector. If the debt collector calls and leaves a name, that debt collector is revealing to me, an unrelated third party, that the individual has a debt in collection. I consider this to be a violation of the spirit of the FDCPA if not the letter. Whenever a debt collector calls me, I am burdened with the knowledge that I now know the name of someone else who has a debt in collection. I've gotten any number of the calls described in #4 telling me not to listen if I'm not the named individual. The big problem with that is that, one again, the name of a debtor is being revealed to me, and then there's the added dilemma of the fact that now my phone number has been programmed into a debt collector's robo dialer. When that happens, the calls continue to come. I always disobey the instructions and listen to the message. I then call the debt collector to report a case of mistaken identity. It's the only way to stop the calls. In all the collection calls I have gotten over the years, I have received only one message with the \"mini-Miranda\" warning. When I called the debt collector to report another case of mistaken identity I was connected with an individual in a call center in India.

{"id": "00810", "input": "Email communication is a huge advantage for all involved parties. Emails provide consumers with much better tools to control how they are being contacted. First, if treating emails as \"in writing\" (as they should), disputing a debt or demanding that collectors cease communication is much easier. Second, setting rules to hide collection notices is a powerful tool not available in any other communication medium. 3rd party disclosure is therefore a lesser concern. Third, email delivery is fast, and facilitates an efficient process, where less communications can be made to reach a settlement. Everything is in writing. Fourth, email is significantly less confrontational than phone calls  and causes much less stress to recipients. Fifth, email is better than recording in keeping record of communication, making it even harder for collectors to hide acts of non compliance. Email should be allowed, while keeping the sensitive parts of the message (disclosures, personal details etc) hidden - as an attachment or as a link that is part of an email. Yes, email is more cost efficient to collectors which is why using email should be conditional on collectors not charging the debtors any fees for their payments.

Much of the discussion has nothing to do with weather the bill is owed but how the contact was made. Have you been harmed by a phone call?

It is a useless tool and a waste of the consumer's time.Asking for validation with a collection agency is almost as useless.This is because current laws suggest that the collection agency provide the consumer with information \"such as\" the name and address of the original creditor, and the amount owed.This does not prove a debt is still owed, and to whom it is owed.If we are going to allow companies to buy debts for amounts as low as pennies on the dollar, then the burden of proof MUST lie with the collection agency.As they are in the business of collecting debts,they are given all information regarding payment history, original contracts, methods of prior payment, and all personal information relating to the consumer.For far too long the consumer has been at the mercy of the collection agency.We are forced to send proof of our identity, current mailing address, phone number, etc. as well as all documentation we have regarding the account that would show an error has been made.The collection agency has this information readily available.And if they do not, the account should be permanently deleted.If the collection agency cannot produce documentation from the original creditor including (1)a contract (2)payment history from original creditor if any (3)proper identification of the consumer (4)proof of purchase of the debt (5)proof they are legally able to collect on the debt in the consumer's state-then there should be laws in place that prevent the debt from being reported.In most cases, it is being reported from the original creditor already.And if it isn't, this should be a red flag to CRA's that the debt is not valid.Collection agencies must be able to show proof that a collection notice was sent,and they should be required to provide the same proof a consumer must provide to prove a dispute was sent (CMRR).If it is required of the consumer, it should be required of all.A debt should be considered validated only when all of these conditions have been met.Without these safeguards, a consumer could end up paying a debt they do not owe.It happens all the time.How many stories have you heard of collection agencies voluntarily providing any

Beyond that the consumer and the collector have the ability to ask a third party, a judge, to make a determination. By all appearances the FTC and the CFPB would place this burden directly on the collector, with predictable results: more needless litigation over the process and less resolution regarding the debt itself. One alternative might be for the rule to state a set formula for verification along with the proviso that if the collector follows it they are provided a safe harbor from litigation.

{"id": "01388", "input": "I appreciate Mr. Bartmann's comments but they appear to be grounded in a collection agency perspective  (there is always business and market share tension between collection agencies and law firms). The reality is that (and this was voiced by other participants) many (not all but many) debtors simply won't/can't pay until they have to. The FDCPA and TCPA have truly made communications with debtor both difficult and hazardous for the collector. For instance, the fact that you can't safely leave a voice message for a debtor should be very troubling. Over the years, our firm has stopped initial outbound calling (responding only to inbound calls) and also limited our pre-suit letters to just two. We send the required disclosure letter and (there being no response and the account reviewed for suit) then send a discounted payment offer that says we are going to file suit but would rather settle. We offer reasonable terms to the debtors to avoid a costly suit but  the response rate is absolutely miserable, probably in the single digits percentage wise. Believe me, suits are time consuming and expensive,  but they are often simply the only option. Even when the debtors are served, few contact us, and even fewer when the court sends them the judgment. Worse, a judgment doesn't guarantee payment on the account. Clarification via Regulations as to what we can say and do in communications would at least promote more communication between the parties. With that, perhaps more points of contact could resolve debts before suit. I strongly disagree that litigation should be \"discouraged\" as it is not only a simple reality in much of debt collection but a fundamental right of a creditor. However, I think Regulations making it clear what can and cannot be done in communications that can shield the industry from the wild west of FDCPA and TCPA lawsuits would greatly encourage more communication. I also think a reasonable, good faith attempt to resolve the case (offering a payment plan and/or lump sum) before suit is filed is still a good idea as well  even though our own response rate has not been great. Anything more will infringe on a creditor's rights and interfere with state law. Perhaps the CFPB Portal could have a debt resolution aspect to it where a debtor could try to resolve an account in a \"safer\" more disarming manner.", "framework": "cdcp", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~jpark/", "source": "https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~jpark/", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 0, "to": 36}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 37, "to": 103}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "CDCP_fact", "anchors": [{"from": 104, "to": 198}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "CDCP_fact", "anchors": [{"from": 199, "to": 337}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 338, "to": 447}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 448, "to": 553}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 554, "to": 701}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 702, "to": 902}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 903, "to": 971}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 972, "to": 1061}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 1062, "to": 1114}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "CDCP_fact", "anchors": [{"from": 1115, "to": 1157}]}, {"id": 12, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 1158, "to": 1262}]}, {"id": 13, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 1263, "to": 1322}]}, {"id": 14, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 1323, "to": 1462}]}, {"id": 15, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 1463, "to": 1537}]}, {"id": 16, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 1538, "to": 1597}]}, {"id": 17, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 1598, "to": 1698}]}, {"id": 18, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 1699, "to": 1908}]}, {"id": 19, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 1909, "to": 2067}]}, {"id": 20, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 2068, "to": 2121}]}, {"id": 21, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 2122, "to": 2202}]}, {"id": 22, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 2203, "to": 2351}]}], "edges": [{"source": 16, "target": 17, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 19, "target": 21, "label": "CDCP_reason"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 22]}
