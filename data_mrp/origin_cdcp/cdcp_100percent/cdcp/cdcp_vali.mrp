A debt collector can call the debtor from a phone number outside of the collector's company so it won't be included in the company's phone log. If the debtor attempts to return the phone call, the number is either inoperable or not able to receive incoming calls.

{"id": "00823", "input": "It's a good question, but unfortunately the answer is (of course) complicated. Manually dialing phones slows down businesses and raises costs; Automated dialing has preventive measures built in that manually dialing does not. To expand on the first point, debt collectors are cost centers, meaning their primary goal is to minimize costs (i.e., delinquent monies). An automated dialing system allows for a much more efficient manner of calling delinquent account-holders. Representatives are able to review the account history and status while the system connects the call, so the rep can quickly engage the customer. If a customer has given their cell phone or home number to the lender knowing it may be used for future contact attempts, there is no difference to the customer if the call is executed through a computer or dialer on the keypad. To expand on the second point, automated dialing systems have a lot of built in controls that actually protect the consumer. People make mistakes, and so do collectors: Automated dialers can have filters in place that restrict calls to customers based on location, time of day, or even how many attempts have already been made. In addition, calls made through the dialer can all be recorded so if there is a problem with the representative, the customer can refer back to the recording and the truth will come out.", "framework": "cdcp", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~jpark/", "source": "https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~jpark/", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 0, "to": 21}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 22, "to": 78}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 79, "to": 142}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "CDCP_fact", "anchors": [{"from": 143, "to": 225}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 226, "to": 364}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 365, "to": 471}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "CDCP_fact", "anchors": [{"from": 472, "to": 573}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 574, "to": 617}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 618, "to": 846}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 847, "to": 971}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 972, "to": 1015}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "CDCP_fact", "anchors": [{"from": 1016, "to": 1174}]}, {"id": 12, "label": "CDCP_fact", "anchors": [{"from": 1175, "to": 1237}]}, {"id": 13, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 1238, "to": 1361}]}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 5, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 2, "target": 6, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 2, "target": 7, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 3, "target": 9, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 3, "target": 11, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 3, "target": 12, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 3, "target": 13, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 5, "target": 7, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 7, "target": 6, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 9, "target": 11, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 9, "target": 12, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 9, "target": 13, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 13, "target": 12, "label": "CDCP_reason"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 10]}

{"id": "01164", "input": "As a college grad since 1979 and a first-time homebuyer, I have found widespread violations of the FDCPA among the creditors and their outsourced private collections agencies. I've also found and been a victim of deception in the debt collection practice observing poor record keeping on the part of all parties. We must first examine debt collection from a derivative and forensic viewpoint; corporate finance, federally/state funded institutions and their debt obligations. GAAP allows for the write-off of old debts. Yet and still the creditors outsource collection agencies to collect debts the creditor has written off of their balance sheet. The debtor is always subject to the debt because the collection agency takes a percentage Then comes the finance charge (interest) and late payment charges. In essence, the original debt remains the same because the debtor is only paying commission, interest and late charges. I attended a Texas private college (state funded) that lost its accreditation for mismanagement of funds. My financial aid consisted of the BEOG, NDSL, Stafford Loan and the Merit Scholarship. The school policy was to clear the balance of my bill before my grades were released. Each grade period, whatever the balance was, my Mom used the funds she had left from our Social Security Income (father deceased 1972) after paying monthly expenses to send to me for my grades to be released. After my marriage, the Dept of Ed (Higher Ed) offset two years of joint tax returns, private collection agencies constantly called. When I was employed, I voluntarily paid $50/mo. for two years on this debt of which the principle was $4,650. Even after over 30 yrs., the debt was recorded as a Federal Abstract of Judgement at the county registrar (filed by private attorneys) as if I still owe the debt. I wasn't properly served. The process server (whomever it was) left a large manila envelope. Now the debt has been turned over to the Dept. of Justice in the State of Michigan. My point is that there is a widespread conflict of interest among the creditor and those outsourced by the creditor for debt collection. Most, if not all of these organizations are operated by taxpayer funding. The taxpayers are the ultimate creditors.", "framework": "cdcp", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~jpark/", "source": "https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~jpark/", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 0, "to": 175}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 176, "to": 312}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "CDCP_policy", "anchors": [{"from": 313, "to": 475}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "CDCP_fact", "anchors": [{"from": 476, "to": 519}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "CDCP_fact", "anchors": [{"from": 520, "to": 647}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 648, "to": 688}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "CDCP_fact", "anchors": [{"from": 689, "to": 737}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "CDCP_fact", "anchors": [{"from": 738, "to": 804}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "CDCP_fact", "anchors": [{"from": 805, "to": 851}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "CDCP_fact", "anchors": [{"from": 852, "to": 924}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 925, "to": 1030}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 1031, "to": 1117}]}, {"id": 12, "label": "CDCP_fact", "anchors": [{"from": 1118, "to": 1203}]}, {"id": 13, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 1204, "to": 1412}]}, {"id": 14, "label": "CDCP_fact", "anchors": [{"from": 1413, "to": 1544}]}, {"id": 15, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 1545, "to": 1654}]}, {"id": 16, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 1655, "to": 1817}]}, {"id": 17, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 1818, "to": 1843}]}, {"id": 18, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 1844, "to": 1910}]}, {"id": 19, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 1911, "to": 1994}]}, {"id": 20, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 1995, "to": 2131}]}, {"id": 21, "label": "CDCP_fact", "anchors": [{"from": 2132, "to": 2205}]}, {"id": 22, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 2206, "to": 2247}]}], "edges": [{"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "CDCP_reason"}, {"source": 17, "target": 16, "label": "CDCP_reason"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]}

I urge the CFPB to create mechanisms for clerks & citizens that make it 1) easier to fix these messes &, 2) to bring sanctions against lawyers & judges for MISUSE OF LEGAL PROCEDURE, ABUSE OF PROCESS, WRONGFUL CIVIL PROCEEDINGS, & MALICIOUS PROSECUTION.", "framework": "cdcp", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~jpark/", "source": "https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~jpark/", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 0, "to": 60}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 61, "to": 214}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 215, "to": 240}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 241, "to": 317}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 318, "to": 415}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "CDCP_policy", "anchors": [{"from": 416, "to": 669}]}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 0, "label": "CDCP_reason"}], "tops": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}
{"id": "01321", "input": "I had to spend quite a bit of time dealing with their repeated calls. Of course, they weren't looking for me but rather for someone with my very common last name and first initial. I had many calls from them one day. Apparently, their telephone representatives were trained to hang up if they received any response other than, \"How do I pay?\" They'd hang up on me before I could complete a sentence. That particular day, either by accident or through malice (I suspect the latter.), they had their robo dialer programmed to call back immediately. The representative would hang up on me  and before I could step away from the phone, the robo dialer would call me back  and I'd be speaking with another representative who would hang up on me. After many such calls and hang-ups, I was finally able to get a representative to stay on the line with me long enough for me to explain that they were calling the wrong person. After that the calls stopped. As I think back on this experience, I find it quite comical,  but I didn't at the time. I did file complaints with the FTC and my state's Attorney General.", "framework": "cdcp", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~jpark/", "source": "https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~jpark/", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 0, "to": 69}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 70, "to": 180}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 181, "to": 216}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 217, "to": 342}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 343, "to": 399}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 400, "to": 482}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 483, "to": 546}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 547, "to": 586}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 587, "to": 667}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 668, "to": 740}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 741, "to": 918}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 919, "to": 948}]}, {"id": 12, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 949, "to": 1010}]}, {"id": 13, "label": "CDCP_value", "anchors": [{"from": 1011, "to": 1036}]}, {"id": 14, "label": "CDCP_testimony", "anchors": [{"from": 1037, "to": 1104}]}], "edges": [], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]}
