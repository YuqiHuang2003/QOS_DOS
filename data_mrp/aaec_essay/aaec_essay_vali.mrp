{"id": "essay190", "input": "Do zoos serve any useful function?\n\nIt has become quite a common hobby of children that they usually spend their free time in zoos. Zoos have been established for ages all over the world and have become interesting places for entertainment. Over the time, there are also a lot of arguments concerning whether zoos are helpful in serving people or they are just some kinds of bad treatments to animals.\nSome people spot out that humanities benefit so much from zoos. First of all, zoos are fascinating places of entertainment. For this point, they all think that the very nature and wildness are all brought into zoos and spending time there help us to forget all stress as well as pressure. Another function that all zoos serve relates to education. Many students as well as people find zoos as good places for witnessing and researching the true animal world. Moreover, some zoos are also reservation sites of many animals that are about to become extinct.\nOn the other hand, there are, however, people who think that zoos just take away freedom of animals. Being confined, animals may lose their own nature as well as wildness and feel upset and discontented. In their opinion, zoos are some kind of prisons and it's so cruel and wrong to keep animal in such prisons.\nFrom my point of view, I agree with the first group. In modern life, zoos have become even more important in serving as places for people to study and enjoy the nature while a lot of natural destruction is made to build towers and skyscrapers. Besides, recently, zookeepers have also tried their best to make animals feel more comfortable by making artificial landscapes more familiar to the nature, taking care all animals in both feeding and sanity.", "framework": "aaec_essay", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 428, "to": 464}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 480, "to": 524}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 562, "to": 689}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 713, "to": 748}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 750, "to": 859}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 871, "to": 956}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "AAEC_Claim:Against", "anchors": [{"from": 1019, "to": 1057}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1059, "to": 1160}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1180, "to": 1268}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "AAEC_MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 1323, "to": 1512}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 1523, "to": 1720}]}], "edges": [{"source": 0, "target": 1, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 0, "target": 3, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 0, "target": 5, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 3, "target": 4, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 6, "target": 8, "label": "AAEC_supports"}], "tops": [0, 6, 9, 10]}
{"id": "essay275", "input": "Children managing their own money - best way to learn responsibility\n\nOne of the best characteristics of a mature adult is responsibility, specially in financially matters. Actually what is the best way to learn responsibility? many people argue about learning their children the financial responsibility in young ages or in adulthood. I am a kind of person who believes to children should learn to manage their own money at a young age, due to reasons that I stated below.\nThe first important point that I want to make is that sociologists found that our characteristics and personality forms early in life, even though when we are not borne. So it is crucial to learn our children as soon as possible to learn financially issues. To clarify my point I would like to say a memory from my childhood, when I was at age 7 my father gave me monthly money to buy thing that I liked. First time I spend the whole money to eat at school and my money finished. I asked my father for extra money, but he refuse to give it to me. I found that I should manage the way that I spend money. From then I learned to be economical and now I have every thing I wanted.\nAnother aspect of learning children to manage their money is on the finance of the family. If parents get the children all they wanted, they would be run out of their money for their essential needs. Even in rich families if children did not learn to manage their own money, when they grow up they will become unappreciative and dependent persons who want to just used their parents prosperity. As a case in point, I had a friend to had a rich and prosperous family, his parent gave him everything he demanded from his childhood. He became an arrogant person who could not stand on his feet and always asked for money. His parent tried a lot and hired some experts to learn him manage his financial and carrier life, but unfortunately it was useless. Finally one night, having fun with his irresponsible friend in his luxuries car, he crashed a truck and died. Not only did he cause lots of damage to the society property, but also bring sorry to his family.\nAlthough some people argue that children should be free to spend money to they what they want, In my opinion it is very important to learn our children from their beginning of their life to be financially responsible persons, because our personality form in childhood and it is not easy to change it in adulthood.", "framework": "aaec_essay", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "AAEC_MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 374, "to": 436}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 528, "to": 642}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 647, "to": 730}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 800, "to": 877}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 879, "to": 952}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 954, "to": 1019}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1021, "to": 1076}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1088, "to": 1150}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1243, "to": 1350}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 1352, "to": 1545}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1567, "to": 1680}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1682, "to": 1769}]}, {"id": 12, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1771, "to": 1901}]}, {"id": 13, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1903, "to": 2011}]}, {"id": 14, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 2013, "to": 2109}]}, {"id": 15, "label": "AAEC_Claim:Against", "anchors": [{"from": 2143, "to": 2204}]}, {"id": 16, "label": "AAEC_MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 2220, "to": 2335}]}, {"id": 17, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 2345, "to": 2423}]}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 1, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 2, "target": 4, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 2, "target": 5, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 2, "target": 6, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 2, "target": 7, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 9, "target": 8, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 9, "target": 10, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 9, "target": 11, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 9, "target": 12, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 9, "target": 13, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 9, "target": 14, "label": "AAEC_supports"}], "tops": [0, 2, 9, 15, 16, 17]}
{"id": "essay015", "input": "Email and text messaging threats written language\n\nThe introduction of email and text messaging has brought about considerable changes in communication. With this situation, some people believe that they may be factors decreasing the position of written language. I am in favor of that idea because of their advantages and the fact we can see today about the use of these new means.\nFirst of all, it is easy to point out many benefits users can get from email and text messaging, which answers to the question of their great popularity. Before email and mobile phone, human beings communicated by meeting directly, sending letters or later, calling from home phones. Such ways usually made people have troubles for the expensiveness, difficulties in far communication or emergency and the loss of information. However, email and cell phones have improved the obstacles above. People can send or receive electronic letters anywhere and anytime they want. Especially, thanks to the function provided by email and text messaging (SMS), it is cheaper and faster to transfer a lot of information, even to many people at the same time. They are so convenient that the majority of population prefer to use them instead of some traditional ways.\nThe popularity of email and text messaging, as a result, leads to the losing of written language's position. People tend to use slangs and abbreviated words to shorten their writing and save more time in communicating for other activities. The outcome is that language in writing is not in its original form. Even in some cases, people compose a message with only emoticons (the expressions by face created by service providers), which means there is no room for writing or typing texts. Moreover, it is more dangerous that youngsters sometimes use such new languages in their studying, writing assignments. If that tendency continues at a rapid pace, written language may face up to a real problem about its stand.\nIn conclusion, we cannot deny the threat from email and text messaging to the status of written language because their obvious popularity. Nevertheless, educators and individuals themselves, especially the youths should pay ore attention to this matter so that we can take advantages of the new language along with preserving the traditional one.", "framework": "aaec_essay", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "AAEC_MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 199, "to": 262}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 397, "to": 535}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 537, "to": 665}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 667, "to": 808}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 819, "to": 874}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 876, "to": 952}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 966, "to": 1128}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1130, "to": 1236}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 1238, "to": 1345}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1347, "to": 1476}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1498, "to": 1545}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1567, "to": 1724}]}, {"id": 12, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1736, "to": 1844}]}, {"id": 13, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1846, "to": 1952}]}, {"id": 14, "label": "AAEC_MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 1969, "to": 2091}]}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 1, "target": 3, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 1, "target": 5, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 1, "target": 6, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 1, "target": 7, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 8, "target": 10, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 8, "target": 12, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 8, "target": 13, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 10, "target": 9, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "AAEC_supports"}], "tops": [0, 1, 8, 14]}

Different people attend university for different point of views. In my perspective, the three most reasons are increased knowledge, career preparation and new experiences.\nFirst of all, for most people, university is an ideal place for them to develop their understanding. Truthfully, in this wonderful academic environment, everyone is provided with varieties and gigantic number of information by a lot of professors and well-trained teachers. Thus, people are able to strengthen their knowledge. Moreover, through the instructions of teachers, the sufficient infrastructure such as laboratory, library, students is capable of doing research on every academic aspect. Therefore, they can gain a deep sight into what are they studying.\nSecondly, studying in university means that you have totally turned into a different page of your life, which included many new experiences. The number of individual who enroll in university are enormous, more than any school one person have studied. Thus, students are given such fantastic chance to create new and wide relationships with a lot of people from any corner of one nation, even from the whole world. For instance, my brother are studying in an international university with a mixed community include Vietnam, Brazil, Argentina, etc. And he told me that he is very excited for experiencing such new environment, which is one of his main purposes when attending university. \nLast but not least, preparing for career is an essential function of university. Students not only do homework, assignment and attend class but also need to participate in volunteer work, internship and part time job. Thus, they can have some experiences in the outside world and discover what their life goals are. After all, they know where and what to put high emphasis on in order to achieve their objectives.\nIn summation, people may attend university for various reasons.

Here are my reasons. \nStudying at home by using technology is convenient. The biggest advantage is that your classroom and instructor are available 24 hours a day. In addition, you could make your own schedule for completing the requirements of the course. You can study any time you want. However, if you aren't extremely dedicated or have good time management skills, it may be very difficult to complete a course at home.\nFirst, attending an education course at home requires persistence and patience. Especially when you don't have an instructor there to guide you, it is up to you to make sure that you understand and complete all course requirements. Students may raise questions and they may have problems of understanding some specific topics or subjects. Unfortunately, it may be a predicament when you face some problems in learning without any help. \nSecond, studying at home is very different from traditional learning. Unlike traditional classes, distance education courses don't take place in a classroom, where you are surrounded by your teachers and classmates. Students may find that it is hard to study without being kept under supervision. If you are the type that gets easily distracted, a distance-learning program may not be for you.\nFurthermore, there is an advantage of traditional school - socialization- establishes relationship with classmates. We can learn a lot from programs at home; however, our computers or televisions can't teach us how to get along with people.

However, I strongly believe that human activities are having a bad effect upon our planet, for human are polluting the Earth's environment, exhausting natural resource and threatening the living of other species.\nPeople are corrupting their ecosphere. In recent decades, concurrently with the increase of human consume, the waste discarded by human also multiplies. These wastes including household waste and industrial waste are so big that a \"new\" continent is now being formed in the sea from garbage. Furthermore, the industrial exhaust gases are adulterating the air, causing the insalubrious phenomenon such as acid rain, global warming or climate change.\nBesides, people are draining the Earth's natural resources. These resources such as oil, coal are vital for human activity, therefore nowadays, the exploitation activities of these resources are increasing dramatically to adapt to the infinite need of people. Researchers indicated that most of natural resources are un-recyclable and only several decades after, the Earth's natural resources are totally exhausted. At that time, human activity will be seriously affected due to the dependence on these resources.\nAlso, people are endangering other species' live. Hunting has been a fundamental activity of human for having food. Through million years of hunting, especially in recent centuries with the innovation of rifle and dynamite, people have killed many animals and even have made some kinds of them become extinct. Moreover, people, suffering from the population pressure, are expanding their living area; consequently, the living area of other species narrowed. This narrowing of living region is pushing many creatures to the brink of extinction.\nAll in all, from discussed reasons, we can conclude that human activity are gradually destroy the Earth since it is polluting the Earth environment, depleting the resource and imperiling other species' lives.", "framework": "aaec_essay", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "AAEC_MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 291, "to": 347}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 353, "to": 469}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 471, "to": 508}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 510, "to": 622}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 624, "to": 761}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 776, "to": 918}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 929, "to": 978}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 980, "to": 1042}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1054, "to": 1178}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1180, "to": 1334}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1336, "to": 1432}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 1440, "to": 1482}]}, {"id": 12, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1484, "to": 1548}]}, {"id": 13, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1550, "to": 1742}]}, {"id": 14, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1754, "to": 1833}]}, {"id": 15, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1849, "to": 1890}]}, {"id": 16, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1892, "to": 1976}]}, {"id": 17, "label": "AAEC_MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 2035, "to": 2081}]}, {"id": 18, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 2088, "to": 2185}]}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 2, "target": 4, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 2, "target": 5, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 6, "target": 8, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 6, "target": 9, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 6, "target": 10, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 11, "target": 12, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 11, "target": 13, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 11, "target": 15, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 15, "target": 14, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 15, "target": 16, "label": "AAEC_supports"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 6, 11, 17, 18]}

The apperant example is that there are a lot of tests that do not allow team-working. Let's imagine that you perform really well when you can discuss the problems with other people, but you have no experience of working alone, standardized tests such as SAT, TOEFL may be your nightmares. Testing is a very important aspect of life, and still the majority of tests do not allow you to work in team. Therefore, if you want to get brilliant achievements such as going to college, acing your school's final tests, you should consider learning to work on your own.\nMoreover, the ability to work alone will help you increase your ability to work with other people. Working in team does not mean that you do not have to come up with your ideas. Everybody in a team must have his/her own opinion first, then discuss them with other members. When we work in team, we still think individually because our brain are not connected but separate. When everyone in a team can come up with his/her own ideas, working in team will definitely more effective.\nIn conclusion, working with a group a people and working individually are all important.

{"id": "essay230", "input": "Parents can help their teenage children prepare for adult life\n\nNowadays, the society has become exceedingly competitive than ever before, parents have the responsibilitis to teach their children to survive and to be indepedent from them, just as animals teach their offspring skills of finding foods. Parents can use many methods to guide them to achieve that, for example, asking them to do some housework or clean the rooms by themselves. In my views, I agree that it is the best way for teenage children to take a part-time job to prepare their adult life for several reasons.\nFirst of all, when children get a job, they are able to earn money by themselves, instead of getting pocket money from their parents. Thus, it is an oppertunity to learn how to deal with money. Take me as an example, when I was 16, I found a job during summer vacation and earned some money by own. At the beginning of the semester, I was told to buy a text book. Unfortunately, I spent most of my salary hanging out with my friend. Therefore, I finally realized that I should learn to make a plan before I spend my money, and that did influence me in my life now.\nSecondly, by taking a part-time job, they certainly have to be responsible for anything they have done. For instance, if a student get a job in a company but he is frequently late for work, the company may reduce his payment or even fire him. To compare with the school life, they might suffer only a small punishment at school. Under the circumstances, he will learn that he has to obey the rule and take responsibility for their work.\nIn conclusion, to help their children to adapt adult life, parents should let them experience it as much as they can.

{"id": "essay312", "input": "I'm against providing more money to professors\n\nUniversity education is always an important part of one's life. That's why education in university is discussed all the time. What is the best way to orientate the students? Raising the salaries of professors so? I would say no. The professors are essential, however, the schools are established for students. Money should spend on facilities in school or update resources, which are beneficial to school rather than just instructors. The following are my opinions. \nTo begin with, the school should put more emphasis on students instead of professors. I think the most efficient way to improve the education is to guide the students to learn actively. By renewing some facilities in school so students will spend more time at school doing assignment. A comfortable environment can attract people to stay longer. Thus, students spend more time on school to make a good circulation of learning. That is to say, students have a better environment to working on their assignments so the quality of their assignments will improve. Thus, the competition between peers enhances and forms a circulation. In my school, the classrooms in my university are old and kind of shabby. For me, I prefer spending money in a coffee shop to staying at school to finish my assignment. It's unpleasant to stay at school. However, coffee shops are not always quiet, so my classmates and I often finish our work roughly.\nBesides, the ultimate purpose is to change, to motivate students to be better. To improve education, spending more money to raise professors' salary is inappropriate. In addition, will the university filter all the professors overall? Some professors don't deserve the money at all, then, what's the point to spend money on them? High-salary instructors don't teach students harder because they earn more money. There won't be any effect if school does so. There was news about raising professors' salary in my country. This event provoked a demonstration composing of students mostly. The proposal of the demonstration was eliminating the raising salaries. As you can see, if the policy of raising salary was supported, the demonstration would not happen. \nAt school, students are priority. Students' tuition is not only for the professors but also for their quality of learning at university. That's the main reason I against providing more money to professors. Students are those who suppose to enjoy the use of their tuition.

{"id": "essay092", "input": "should one follow fashion trends rather than a personal style?\n\nWith increasing availability to the Internet, people can collect a wealth of information about the latest fashion trends over the world, such as the most popular shoes style this season or the best-liked clothes color this year. However, some people think that dressing in a personal style should be advocated rather than following fashion trends. From my perspective, fashion trends have a more essential role to play in people's lives than personal dressing styles.\nThis is because following fashion trends enables people to keep up with the world's latest transformations, which is of vital importance if we consider the fact that people are living in a global village today. When individuals keep the habit of grasping the world's cutting-edge fashion information, they are gradually changing their attitudes to viewing the world, which means they are more open to accept diverse voices from people around the world. In contrast, if they stuck to their own fashion styles, disregarding the world's top fashion designers' achievements, they would stay conservative in their own worlds. As a result, they might fall behind shortly.\nFurthermore, people with inadequate aesthetic knowledge or poor originality develop their own senses of fashion when treasuring the latest fashion information. Without following fashion trends, such people would have a hard time choosing and matching clothes, let alone forming their own dressing styles.\nDespite this, it is undeniable that following fashion trends constantly may undermine individuals' personalities. Individuals purchase their clothes according to the latest fashion trends, which may result in the phenomenon that people would wear the same style of clothes. Consequently, the world would look monotonous.\nWith those arguments in mind, I would conclude that people should, especially for ones lacking basic aesthetic knowledge, care more about fashion trends in lives as they can keep pace with the world's changes. On the other hand, creative design talents can value their own dressing ideas, developing their own fashion styles as they like.\n", "framework": "aaec_essay", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "AAEC_MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 433, "to": 530}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 548, "to": 741}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 743, "to": 983}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 998, "to": 1151}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1166, "to": 1196}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1211, "to": 1356}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 1358, "to": 1501}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1539, "to": 1615}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1617, "to": 1775}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "AAEC_Claim:Against", "anchors": [{"from": 1791, "to": 1822}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "AAEC_MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 1876, "to": 2032}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "AAEC_Claim:Against", "anchors": [{"from": 2053, "to": 2161}]}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 6, "target": 5, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 9, "target": 7, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 9, "target": 8, "label": "AAEC_supports"}], "tops": [0, 1, 6, 9, 10, 11]}

And also dancing to entertain people. I will give reasons to support my opinion.\nFirst, dancing are significant part of culture that could show to something that people believe. For example, some culture people believe that they dance in order to sacrifice to their god so they will be get a happy life.

The way of movement, the way that they costume and also a music while they dance. All this is a civilization of their culture.\nThirdly, many culture, people have many ways to entertain themselves.

Some people think that computer is good for children and it should be used daily by children but some others think differently. In my opinion, the latter opinion is true.\nFirst, using computer constantly has bad influence on children's eyes. When they concentrate on computer for too long, their eyes will get tired, which is the main reason for some eyes problems, typically shortsighted.\nMoreover, children who play games too much on computer can seriously lack communicating skills, they will know little about the outside life. It is a well-known fact that people who are addicted to games, especially online games, can eventually bear dangerous consequences. For instance, several teenagers play games without rest, which leads to health depression, a typical example is the death of Korean gamer, who had a non-stop playing for 3 days.\nFinally, even people who are not interested in online game can still be negatively affected by using computer too much. Some social surveys have shown that a few children use computer for studying purpose, most of them are attracted by facebook, blog, etc. instead. Due to this neglect, they will have a bad result in school because when they can not live without internet, they will have no time for their studying.\nIn conclusion, although it is undeniable that computer is a crucial part of human life, it still has its bad side, especially for children. People should learn how to use it properly to make it an effective tool because computer should be used not only for entertaining but also for working and studying purpose.\n", "framework": "aaec_essay", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 311, "to": 373}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 375, "to": 521}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 533, "to": 617}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 619, "to": 663}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 694, "to": 795}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 811, "to": 886}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 888, "to": 973}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 984, "to": 1093}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1095, "to": 1239}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1262, "to": 1299}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1308, "to": 1390}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "AAEC_Claim:Against", "anchors": [{"from": 1416, "to": 1478}]}, {"id": 12, "label": "AAEC_MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 1480, "to": 1530}]}], "edges": [{"source": 0, "target": 1, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 4, "target": 2, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 4, "target": 5, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 9, "target": 10, "label": "AAEC_supports"}], "tops": [0, 4, 7, 11, 12]}

In my opinion high school should permit students to choose courses they want for several reasons which are freedom of choice, to have progress in students grades and knowledge as well as to help students explore their aptitude.\nFirst of all, as I mentioned above students should have a right to choose what they want to study. Not allowing students their desired subjects to be chosen is a restriction of human rights. As children of independent country we should know our rights and opportunities we have in order to achieve our goals and dreams.\nNext, students should choose their classes to have progress in their studies and grades. Also, we can avoid conflicts among students and teachers which can be enjoyable and productive for both instructor and students. For example, when I was taking art class everyone shared the same interests and it was easy to understand each other. Giving chance students to choose their interested fields of study is merit.\nLastly, the most important reason I support this idea is he or she can explore in an area she/he has an aptitude. When schools can give such kind of opportunity the students are likely do their best and succeed in their future lives which is one of the point most people get education. Furthermore, this type of opportunities can raise future geniuses.\nIn conclusion, as a young women I want my children to get knowledge they have desire to study in order to have distinguished achievement so it has advantage not only for him or her but for society as well.

{"id": "essay043", "input": "Sporting events easing international tensions, releasing patriotic feelings\n\nFor most folks on Earth, the need to gather in one place, and enjoy competition with other talented people from different cultures through popular games has always been a strong motivation. This trend is so deeply engraved in people's mind that the organisation of such events continue to be planned, even when some participants are facing grievous social problems. It is agreed that large scale sports games make people focus on attractive contests instead of international disputes, and help them being proud of their nation. This will be proved by analysing how sports events may be an important link to the peace, and by how they encourage people to display their national symbols.\nFirstly, during times of war, people living in badly affected countries can forget about the gloomy environment and maintain a link with the rest of the world by listening to international sports event. For example, when Irak was hardly struck by the Second Gulf War, its citizens tried to catch any incoming news about the FootballWorld Cup through their portable receivers. This clearly shows that international sports competitions encourage people and put pressure on them to come back, sooner or later, to a relative peaceful normality. Thus, world sports events strongly participate in eventually pulling back people towards friendship and peace.\nSecondly, these sporting occasions are a good opportunity for people to be proud of their country. For instance, when the Football World Cup was organised in South Africa, its citizens filled up the stadiums, cheered and waved national flags to support their national team on the field. South African national and traditional songs were played in the streets throughout the night. This example demonstrates how people might take numerous elements from their roots and history to proudly display them while supporting their team. As a result, it is clear that people can freely express their patriotic feelings during international sports events.\nIn conclusion, after analysing the effects of world games both for countries at war and for organising countries, it is clear that they not only constitute a tremendous appeal towards a peaceful society, but also guide the public demonstrations of national proudness. This has been true for centuries and will certainly not change in the foreseeable future.\n", "framework": "aaec_essay", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "AAEC_MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 461, "to": 603}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 772, "to": 964}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 979, "to": 1137}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1163, "to": 1302}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 1310, "to": 1413}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1425, "to": 1512}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1528, "to": 1700}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1702, "to": 1794}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1796, "to": 1942}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 1957, "to": 2059}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "AAEC_MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 2175, "to": 2327}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 2329, "to": 2417}]}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 1, "target": 3, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 4, "target": 1, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 9, "target": 5, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 9, "target": 6, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 9, "target": 7, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 9, "target": 8, "label": "AAEC_supports"}], "tops": [0, 4, 9, 10, 11]}
{"id": "essay055", "input": "Should teenagers learn all school subjects/focus on one subject\n\nPresently, it is commonly accepted that students have to learn over eight subjects in school. Public retain differing views on whether to teach students all subjects or just focus on one subject. Some parents are satisfied with the full class schedule of their children. While, others claim that studying only one subject is more effective. Before rendering my own opinion, I will explore sides of this topic.\nThe benefits of teaching students different units are easily recognized. In the first place, with some basic knowledge of diverse fields, students have more options in choosing specialized areas or jobs in the future. Teenagers are still too young and immature to decide what they are going to dedicate. In students' point of view, the combination of difficult and easy subjects balances their schoolwork stress and fosters their enthusiasm on classes. However, still many teenagers cannot enjoy the variation of the curriculum, instead, they feel more stressful with so much homework and exams to be done. Besides, most students regard the extra knowledge useless and impractical for their future jobs.\nThose who advocate focusing on one subject believe that this education model can cultivate more talents who specialized in different areas and increase studying effectiveness. This is probably because students can devote more time and efforts in one subject and reduce pressure from other subjects. However, the drawbacks of this teaching method cannot be neglected. Most importantly, under such target-oriented education environment, teenagers may be hard to regret their original choice and change their specialized field in their further study. Moreover, the dullness of course may deeply influence their passion on study.\nIt is undeniable that concentrating on one subject can reduce students' pressure and foster the effectiveness in training talents, while its shortfalls are so vital to students' future. Therefore, I do support the view of learning all school subjects.\n", "framework": "aaec_essay", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 475, "to": 546}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 568, "to": 691}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 693, "to": 777}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 779, "to": 926}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 937, "to": 1080}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1091, "to": 1177}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "AAEC_Claim:Against", "anchors": [{"from": 1235, "to": 1353}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1380, "to": 1476}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1564, "to": 1725}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1737, "to": 1803}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 1827, "to": 1989}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "AAEC_MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 2002, "to": 2055}]}], "edges": [{"source": 0, "target": 1, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 0, "target": 2, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 0, "target": 3, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 0, "target": 4, "label": "AAEC_attacks"}, {"source": 0, "target": 5, "label": "AAEC_attacks"}, {"source": 6, "target": 7, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 6, "target": 8, "label": "AAEC_attacks"}, {"source": 6, "target": 9, "label": "AAEC_attacks"}], "tops": [0, 6, 10, 11]}
{"id": "essay254", "input": "Environmental protection vs Economic developments\n\nEnvironmental protection and economic developments might be the biggest issues in the 21st century. They are both important because they are vital to human's future and welfare. However, since the budget and the recourse are limited, governments must choose between these two issues. In my opinion, I believe that tackling down environmental problems is of the first priority rather than economic developments. The following are reasons why. \nFirst, environmental protection is far more urgent than economic developments. All the living creatures live together on our mother Earth and she is the only one. Without Earth, whatever great civil constructions and economic achievements will end up in vain because we will all perish as she's gone. Just like a man that needs a healthy body, all the living creatures as a whole needs a strong planet as well. \nSecond, the influence on environmental problems are boarder and more profound than economic issues. Environmental problems are global rather than local, which means that no countries can be spared from these problems. Take global warming for example, when the temperature increases, the whole globe is affected, suffering the hotter weather together. The melting ice mountain not only jeopardizes habitats of animals living in the polar region, but its effects of the rising sea level also endangers the residents living in the small island near the equator, since the rising sea water could drown them. Environmental issues can not be divided by nationality because all humans are simply entwined together by our only home-Earth.\nSome people might argue that economic issues are global and critical as well thus can not be put aside. They may say that if the economic is in a very bad situation, people would revolt instantly, while environmental problems seem to be more like chronic diseases that would not burst out right away. However, the truth is that we've been encountering so many sighs and warnings of global climate anomalies and other environmental crisis right now. It would be unwise to still deny the truth and keep focusing on economic developments and unfortunately, usually the economic developments are even the causes of environmental damages.\nIn conclusion, environmental conservation is more essential than economic developments in the aspects of urgency and ranges of influence. As mentioned in the second paragraph, how can a man live happily if he is unhealthy? Similarly, how can we live safely and joyfully when our home is devastated by, ironically, by ourselves?

{"id": "essay380", "input": "Increased taxation on petrol and diesel fuel to discourage private cars?\n\nThere is no doubt our life has had a change for the better since cars were introduced. However, cars themselves, especially private ones, have exerted severe pressure on the environment and economy for wasteful oil consumption. While many believe that petrol and diesel fuel should be charged with the highest taxation, I strongly disagree with this notion.\nOne can not deny the fact that if petrol and fuel taxation are raised, people might hesitate choosing a personal automobile. Taxation may have tackled the environmental issue simply by diverting people to public transportations such as trains, buses or ferries. Additionally, for those who have already afforded a car, there is a likelihood it is restraint from usage on long journeys or to crowded cities.\nHowever, taxation on flamable resources might backfire by conducing to inflation. To be precise, the more costly petrol is, the higher the price of necessary product: rice, meat or even vegetable. Consequently, people have to turn to cheaper alternatives, which might cause the abundance in goods and later on, economic crisis.\nAnother point that should be taken into account is countries that import oil will be more dependent on the exporters, both politically and financially.

America, for example, has recently drawn its intervention in Russian crisis only due to the influx of oil.\nTo summarize, higher fuel and petrol cost has its own pros and cons.

{"id": "essay281", "input": "Governments should spend money on space exploration or for basic needs of people\n\nAlthough developing technologies to discover amazing thing in galaxy is interesting, there are many people in the world are in poverty or starvation. Thus, these technologies mean nothing if people lack of prosperity. Therefore, in my opinion, I accede with notion that government should pay attention on basic needs of people first.\nFirst, as you can see that after great economic recession, many people in many countries were unemployed. Then, many people did not have money. When people did not have money, They had to rob other people. There were increasing in criminal rate in many cities. Consequently, quality of life were dropping and this make people unhappy. So that, government should invest to create more jobs. When people have jobs, they did not have to steal money. Therefore, criminal rate were drop. Thus, people have a good quality life.\nSecond, environment is also important issue that everyone depend on it. Nowaday, industrial in many countries still emit high intense of carbon dioxide, which caused of greenhouse effect. Greenhouse effect causes of climate change. These impact on every living creature in the world. So, government take care of this issue by declare regulate to control emission of carbon dioxide. In addition to controlling emission carbon dioxide, government should invest in alternative energy such as using solar energy instead of coal energy. If we lived in good environment, our life would be better.\nLastly, family is a root of society. If everyone in family did not have time to spend with each other, that family could have problems, If family had problems, it mean society could have problems. When society had problems, it could impact to a nation. Thus, government should create campaign to fill love to family. For example, setting event once a week to gather everyone in family to spend time with each other. When family understand each other, it mean society and a nation will not have much trouble.\nIn conclusion, I personally agree with statement that government should spend money on basic people needs. The basic needs: jobs, good environment, and love in family. These three issues are the most important basic needs of people in my opinion that government should pay attention on to improve quality life of people.\n", "framework": "aaec_essay", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "AAEC_MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 352, "to": 414}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 443, "to": 520}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 560, "to": 620}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 622, "to": 675}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 691, "to": 749}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 760, "to": 804}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 806, "to": 861}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 874, "to": 897}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 905, "to": 936}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 946, "to": 1008}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1019, "to": 1124}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1126, "to": 1168}]}, {"id": 12, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1170, "to": 1220}]}, {"id": 13, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1226, "to": 1318}]}, {"id": 14, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 1372, "to": 1468}]}, {"id": 15, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1470, "to": 1527}]}, {"id": 16, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1537, "to": 1564}]}, {"id": 17, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1566, "to": 1724}]}, {"id": 18, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1726, "to": 1780}]}, {"id": 19, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 1788, "to": 1844}]}, {"id": 20, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1859, "to": 1943}]}, {"id": 21, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1945, "to": 2035}]}, {"id": 22, "label": "AAEC_MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 2091, "to": 2142}]}, {"id": 23, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 2205, "to": 2356}]}], "edges": [{"source": 3, "target": 2, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 5, "target": 1, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 5, "target": 8, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 7, "target": 6, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 13, "target": 10, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 13, "target": 11, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 13, "target": 12, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 14, "target": 9, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 14, "target": 13, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 14, "target": 15, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 19, "target": 16, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 19, "target": 17, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 19, "target": 18, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 19, "target": 20, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 19, "target": 21, "label": "AAEC_supports"}], "tops": [0, 5, 14, 19, 22, 23]}

The main reason why people are becoming so addicted to sitting at their homes even for the whole day is an advance technology. In earlier times, for instance, even the types of entertainment tools were not in large numbers and all of them required physical presence and as a result they had more outdoor activities. Nowadays people, especially inhabitants of cities, are spending most of their time on sitting in front of TV or other tools.\nNevertheless, there are some other causes why people are experiencing serious medical problems. Firstly, the environment of the modern world polluted very significantly from greenhouse gas emissions and other gasses. Many people, for example, are suffering from allergy because of these gasses. Secondly, foods with a low quality such as fast foods, junk foods and any genetically modified ones are influencing to our health very negatively.

These researches can be aimed for several fields such as business or agriculture. If a university plans to develop a new research in my country and I have to choose between establishing a centre for business research or a centre for agriculture research, I would opt for the second one.\nFirst of all, my country has a lot of land which is useful for the agriculture. Most of these lands are left without any treatment. The centre for research in agriculture can help my co-citizens to better exploit these land. This centre can also help people there to solve their issues related to their land. Especially, if they have no knowledge or education in this field.\nSecondly, the centre for research in agriculture helps the economy of my country to improve. The agriculture field has only thirty percent as a market part. The centre of research can raise the market part of this field by developing the agriculture products. For example, the dates are the most important agriculture product in my country. The centre of research for agriculture can make some research in how to get a good quality of this product, how to treat the Palme and maybe how to treat the land of the palms.\nAnother reason that makes the centre of research for the agriculture more important than the centre of business research is that the first one can create a lot of jobs. Obviously, showing people how to exploit a land and get good agriculture products will push people to think about working in the field of agriculture rather than working in business or other field to make money. \nSome people think that a centre of business research is more important because we have to be in parallel with the advanced countries which have focused in business field.

{"id": "essay186", "input": "Farmland, housing and industry or saving land for animals?\n\nNowadays, there is a prevailing opinion that human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. People who disagree with the point dispute that the decreasing of land for endangered animals will bring damage to ecological balance. As far as I am concerned, I agree with the opinion human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important. The reasons are based on the following aspects.\nFirst, land used for farmland, housing and industry can benefit more to the whole society. There is no deny that the economy of the whole society will be developed with the help of agriculture, real estate industry and industry, in particularly industry which is the pillar industry of national economy, because they produce plenty of profits. What is more, the society will be stable and harmony due to more farmland and industry. It is widely acknowledged that more farmlands and industries can provide more job opportunities which can decrease the unemployment rate and crime rate. Thus the needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.\nSecond, farmland, housing and industry can satisfy the desire of human that living a better life. It is clearly understood that farming, housing and industry provide us the food we eat, place we live, clothes we wear, which are essential to live. Especially in some poor areas, survival is the most significant thing. In addition, highly developed agriculture and industry can improve our living conditions which allow us have a good quality life. \nLast I want to mention is that even though farmland, housing and industry will occupy the land used for endangered animals, it can do good to protect the endangered animals. According to the discuss above, agriculture and industry make a contribution to the economy. With the economy development, we can have more advanced methods to take care of endangered animals. For instant, we can invent new technique to help endangered animals to produce offspring to be sure they would not distinct.\nAll in all, protecting endangered animals is necessary, nevertheless, human needs for farmland, housing and industry are more important.", "framework": "aaec_essay", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "AAEC_MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 398, "to": 463}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 520, "to": 602}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 626, "to": 815}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 825, "to": 855}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 871, "to": 943}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 976, "to": 1096}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 1103, "to": 1166}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 1176, "to": 1264}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1296, "to": 1413}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1415, "to": 1484}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1499, "to": 1614}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1660, "to": 1739}]}, {"id": 12, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 1741, "to": 1789}]}, {"id": 13, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1823, "to": 1882}]}, {"id": 14, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1914, "to": 1982}]}, {"id": 15, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1997, "to": 2107}]}, {"id": 16, "label": "AAEC_Claim:Against", "anchors": [{"from": 2121, "to": 2163}]}, {"id": 17, "label": "AAEC_MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 2179, "to": 2244}]}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 4, "target": 5, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 6, "target": 1, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 6, "target": 2, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 6, "target": 4, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 7, "target": 9, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 7, "target": 10, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 12, "target": 11, "label": "AAEC_attacks"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 12, "target": 14, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 14, "target": 15, "label": "AAEC_supports"}], "tops": [0, 6, 7, 12, 16, 17]}
{"id": "essay164", "input": "Salary increases and promotions to new positions are not the only ways\n\nIt is unquestionable that salary increases and promotions to new positions are very common way to reward employees for good work. Besides the methods, from my point of view, providing professional training can be effective in encouraging further good work. My arguments for this point are listed follows.\nFirstly, training time can provide employee interesting time outside working office to refresh their mind. Clearly, in company we always have to deal with so many stressful situations such as negotiating with difficult customer, complaining from boss, etc. Therefore, we can unleash uncomfortable in training classes by making new friends, joking in class, enjoying new knowledge.\nSecondly, employees fell that they are valuable if they are trained. In this case, the employees know that their company is investing on them for future development of their company. So obviously, they will think about develop long term career with their company. For another thing, employees will be very proud of themselves when they are provided training while others don't have this opportunity. \nThirdly, providing training will make employees happy with their current job because it help them improve their professional business knowledge. Having professional training help employees gain more confidence in their business, so I believe that they will finish their jobs with excellent result. Of course, excellent working result will make them very happy as well as their boss.\nIn conclusion, providing professional training as a reward for good work has many advantages.

Some universities require students to study in one subject. On the contrary, others require students to study in several subjects. In my point of view, studying many subjects is better that one because students can study in subjects that they interested in, they can gain knowledge more than one field and they will have more chance to choose their future.\nFirst of all, when students finished their high schools, they are confused about subjects that they are going to choose to study in universities. This is because they interested in many subjects and they want to try them all. For example, pupil who want to study science are also like to learn music. Therefore, requiring students to study in many subjects is good for them.\nIn addition, people who know a wide range of is better than people who know just one. Students can gain more knowledge in every different subjects thy study. For instance, university students who study business are also know history of the world. Furthermore, students not only gain knowledge but they also have more experience because they will meet new friends and teachers. Hence, they all can share opinion and knowledge to one another.\nFinally, students who graduated with a variety of courses during university and lots of experience are definitely have more opportunity to choose their future or career. This is because graduates can work in various kind of works which they can select a job they prefer. For example, students will choose a career that they want including the job with high salary include. Moreover, bachelors can earn lots of money by working in other fields due to their knowledge.\nIn concluding, learning several subjects in universities is better than specialize in one subject because it makes students have more chance to gain knowledge to use in their lives and opportunity to choose their own future.

{"id": "essay038", "input": "Technology that widen the gap between rich and poor?\n\nTechnology, in the past two hundred years, has taken a dramatic progress in many fields of our society, such as telecommunications, manufacturing and buildings, etc. Certainly, technologies have also contributed to the great change of our daily lives. However, today some people consider that the range of technology regarding of public has a negative effect on increasing the gap between rich and poor. Personally, I find it hard for me to agree with this opinion by the following reasons.\nIn the first instance, the progress of material technology leads to the sharp fall of price of a great number of products. About ten years ago, mobile phones ware very expensive for most members of my country, only a few of rich individuals have enough money to buy one. Today, mobile phones become a common one of household items, which due to the cheaper materials and better producing technologies. Thus, most members of our society can benefit from the consequences of technical advancements, especially the poor people.\nSecondly, technical developments improve productivity, which help people to escape from daily chores, and invest more time and energy in studying and living a more meaningful life. With the development of Internet, we can enjoy the pleasure and conveniences which it brings about for us every day. In the past time, we had to spend a lot of time searching information and waiting for letters of our friends who lived far away from us. Nowadays, we can talk with our friends online, no matter where we are and how far between us. In addition, the Internet gives everyone access to the same information, this therefore leads to greater equality between individuals.\nUndoubtedly, everything has two sides and technology is not an exception. To some extent, the gap between rich people and poor is widen by technology, because only the rich people have ability to afford the expensive high-tech products, and these products can help them to earn more in return. Nevertheless, I think it is a limp opposition to the remarkable advantages of technology, and technology is not the root cause of the gap.\nIn conclusion, the good technology bringing to us is undeniable. Under proper use of technology, the human being can be benefit a lot and perpetually from the advancement of it.\n", "framework": "aaec_essay", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 568, "to": 666}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 668, "to": 814}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 816, "to": 945}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 953, "to": 1068}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 1080, "to": 1249}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1251, "to": 1366}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1386, "to": 1503}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1515, "to": 1597}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1612, "to": 1670}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1672, "to": 1732}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "AAEC_Claim:Against", "anchors": [{"from": 1824, "to": 1883}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1893, "to": 2026}]}, {"id": 12, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 2050, "to": 2165}]}, {"id": 13, "label": "AAEC_MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 2182, "to": 2230}]}, {"id": 14, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 2232, "to": 2343}]}], "edges": [{"source": 0, "target": 1, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 0, "target": 2, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 3, "target": 0, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 4, "target": 5, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 4, "target": 6, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 4, "target": 7, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 4, "target": 9, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 9, "target": 8, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 10, "target": 12, "label": "AAEC_attacks"}], "tops": [3, 4, 10, 13, 14]}

Some people thought that they should follow the local customs in order to integrate into their adopted countries’ cultures. However I strongly believe that they are able to sustain their cultural identities and doing so help they keep their origin values.\nFirstly, maintaining one’s cultural identity is a key important rule to help individuals emerge in the new multicultural environments. Take Australia for example, immigrants from varieties of nations have a day called multicultural day where people from each country prepare their food and traditional activities for displaying in the public venues. Many Australians come this day to enjoy the shows, learn about the cultures and admire the diverse values. These feedbacks, in turn, help raise one’s pride of their cultures and help people understand each other more. Thus this makes it clear that sustaining the cultural values of immigrants is paramount essential.\nSecondly, it is crucial to keep one’s identity for they need a connection back to their country as well as teach their children their value of origin. For instance, children immigrated to a new country will face social troubles in school with new friends. In this new environment, parent should find friends coming from their same country so that they can socialize in a very familiar manner as feeling being home. Fail to create this familiarity makes them felt isolated, in the extreme can lead to social disorder like autism. Hence, it is clear that keeping the cultural traditions in the destination countries is tremendous important.\nTo conclude, although there are opposing ideas of neglecting one’s cultural values to adapt in the new cultures.

{"id": "essay196", "input": "People learn in different ways and what teaching method do you prefer?\n\nPeople have a lot of things to learn in their lives. They use several ways to broaden their knowledge and their skills. One of these several ways of learning that I prefer is doing things by my self rather than learning by reading about things or learning by listening to people talking about. There are a lot of reasons to recommend this method for who is serious about learning some thing in their lives.\nFirst of all, learning by doing things develops our maturity. When you do things by your self, you learn to depend on yourself. You will not be in need to refer to books or persons. The fact of doing things by ourselves can help us to get some experiences that would strong our maturity. For example if some one wants to learn how to be a leader, they have to experience this by being in a real situation of leading a team or a group, or even a situation. We can not be leaders by reading books or by listening to person talking about leading. \nSecondly, learning by doing things is more exciting than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about. There are a lot of things in life that should be learnt by doing them. Reading about things or listening to people talking about can rarely submit the same sensation or the same excitement to some one who wants to learn about the same thing. People who want to learn how to swim have to go to the beach or to the swimpool and laid themselves in the water to feel and know what is swimming. Nor listening to people or reading about can teach them swimming.\nAnother reason that makes learning by doing things more advantageous than learning by reading about things or listening to people talking about is that we find more motivation to continuing on learning by doing things. With the time, Reading about things or listening to people talking about could become more and more boring. Learning by doing things gives us more and more pleasure especially if we success in learning perfectly this things. So we become motivated to learn other things by doing them.\nThe history shows that learning by doing things is the best way and the best method to learn things. People should not depend only on reading or listening to people talking about things to learn. They should try and keep trying until they learn what they want to learn.

{"id": "essay207", "input": "Young people move to cities\n\nThese days, there are increasing numbers of young people from the countryside moving to cities in search of jobs and educational opportunities. Personally, I think it has some drawbacks that will be discussed in this essay together with some reasons about this.\nTo begin with, the major cause that leads to urban migration of young adults is that cities often offer more well-paid jobs and study chances compared to rural areas. Obviously, many large companies and universities often locate in cities which are hailed as promising lands to develop their career. Therefore they move to big cities to pursue academic career and find jobs in order to have a higher standard of living. For example, if a gradate stays in the city after leaving his college and seeks a job with good salary instead of returning his village to do farm work, he could perhaps buy a house or his own car after a short time. \nHowever, this phenomenon sometimes poses several negative consequences. There can be no doubt that the burgeoning number of young adults from the countryside flocking to cities gives rise to overpopulation in cities. As a result, cities cannot provide adequate space for thousands of dwellers that might lead to poor housing conditions and sanitation. Additionally, it might put strain on the environment. If there are more people in the cities, there would be large numbers of vehicles on the road, which causes air pollution.\nIn conclusion, young people tend to study or work in urban areas since these provide them many educational opportunities and career potentials. In my opinion, however, I do not approve of this trend due to negative effects such as low quality of life and affecting the environment.", "framework": "aaec_essay", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 376, "to": 456}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 469, "to": 589}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "AAEC_Claim:Against", "anchors": [{"from": 601, "to": 709}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 724, "to": 926}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1028, "to": 1144}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 1159, "to": 1279}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1295, "to": 1333}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1335, "to": 1455}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "AAEC_Claim:Against", "anchors": [{"from": 1472, "to": 1521}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1528, "to": 1599}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "AAEC_MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 1625, "to": 1737}]}], "edges": [{"source": 2, "target": 0, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 2, "target": 1, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 2, "target": 3, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 5, "target": 7, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "AAEC_supports"}], "tops": [2, 5, 8, 10]}
{"id": "essay060", "input": "Is a break good or bad after high school for students\n\nStudies are an essential part of life. Some countries permit students to take a break from studies between high school and university studies, while in some countries, it is considered as waste of time. However, a break of one year is good for young people after finishing their high school.\nIn most education systems, a child studies continuously from the age of 5 till 16 years of age. A relaxation of one year to young minds will give them a quintessential change. A continuous study pressure for over 10 years makes the mind saturated and like a robot, to follow instructions. Personally, a break will give students some time to refresh their systems, by traveling or following their hobbies. Importantly, when students start their university studies after a break, they will feel fresh and full of energy to take the new challenge.\nNevertheless, during high school, many students face a dilemma to decide which stream should they major in. Working or traveling for some time, after high school, can help them to find their field of interest. It will also help them to learn professional setup by working. Financially, students can save a little money to support their university education by doing a job. Some students even utilize this time for preparation of their desired university course.\nHowever, there are also disadvantages. A break can disturb the focus of students and prove detrimental. When students work during these breaks, the feel of money gives them an illusion that such salary is enough for them and they go in a utopia. For instance, my cousin started working in a customer care centre after high school and got distracted. When he started his university studies, he failed miserably. Students can also indulge in smoking or drinking during this time. But, the break should be an optional thing. It varies from individual to individual, how they utilize that period. A break gives students more benefits than harms.\nImportantly, the sole purpose of education is to nurture a young mind and not thrust studies on them. Thus, a break should be necessarily allowed to young minds between their high school and university studies. Countries, like India, where such a break is considered a blot, should understand that young minds are delicate and they face a cut-throat competition. One year break can help young people to prepare for the challenges of life.\n", "framework": "aaec_essay", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "AAEC_MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 267, "to": 345}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 443, "to": 521}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 523, "to": 634}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 648, "to": 750}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 765, "to": 890}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 1000, "to": 1100}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1102, "to": 1163}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1165, "to": 1263}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1265, "to": 1352}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "AAEC_Claim:Against", "anchors": [{"from": 1393, "to": 1456}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1458, "to": 1598}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1614, "to": 1702}]}, {"id": 12, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1704, "to": 1763}]}, {"id": 13, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1765, "to": 1830}]}, {"id": 14, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1876, "to": 1945}]}, {"id": 15, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1947, "to": 1994}]}, {"id": 16, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 2009, "to": 2096}]}, {"id": 17, "label": "AAEC_MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 2104, "to": 2205}]}], "edges": [{"source": 3, "target": 1, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 3, "target": 2, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 3, "target": 4, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 5, "target": 7, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 5, "target": 8, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 9, "target": 10, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 9, "target": 13, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 9, "target": 14, "label": "AAEC_attacks"}, {"source": 9, "target": 15, "label": "AAEC_attacks"}, {"source": 10, "target": 11, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 10, "target": 12, "label": "AAEC_supports"}], "tops": [0, 3, 5, 9, 16, 17]}
{"id": "essay107", "input": "Human activities are harming the Earth\n\n\"Save the planet Earth\" is a common line which can be read and heard all over the world. There has been a lot of initiatives to protect the planet Earth from unbridled human developments. Although some people argue these developments are making our life comfortable, but concerns to save Earth are vital due to various reasons.\nFirstly, rapid development of infrastructure is eating most of the forest throughout world. The so-called Concrete jungles have evolved endangering forests and wild life. As we all know life saving oxygen is produced by trees after converting harmful carbon dioxide gas. Moreover, wild life is very essential to maintain ecological balance on planet Earth.\nSecondly, large emissions of carbon monoxide gas from refrigerants like air conditioners have depleted ozone layer. Importance of ozone layer is evident by the fact as it protects us from harmful ultra violet rays. To add to it, excess emission of carbon dioxide gas mainly by vehicles around the world has increased the average temperature at north pole which in turn has increased water level due to gradual melting of glaciers.\nLastly, either industrial waste or domestic waste produced everyday is badly polluting the planet Earth. For instance a large amount of unnoticed industrial waste released in oceans effects aquatic life to a large extent. Harmful chemicals present in industrial waste kills lot of sea creatures in oceans or rivers.\nTo conclude, Earth is our home and it should be protected. Any human activity causing harm to Earth should be controlled and alternate ways should be devised to control damage. Creative ideas should be encouraged to leave minimum environmental footprints without compromising quality of life.\n", "framework": "aaec_essay", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "AAEC_MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 311, "to": 343}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 377, "to": 458}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 460, "to": 537}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 554, "to": 637}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 649, "to": 723}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 735, "to": 839}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 841, "to": 938}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 954, "to": 1154}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "AAEC_Claim:For", "anchors": [{"from": 1164, "to": 1259}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1274, "to": 1376}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "AAEC_Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1378, "to": 1470}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "AAEC_MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 1485, "to": 1529}]}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 1, "target": 3, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 5, "target": 7, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "AAEC_supports"}, {"source": 8, "target": 10, "label": "AAEC_supports"}], "tops": [0, 1, 5, 8, 11]}

There is a viewpoint that the government and big firms should assume the responsibility to protect the environment and normal citizens have nothing to do for that. Personally, I think both government and common people should have the responsibility for the environment, but we need to analyze some specific situations.\nOn one hand, solving some environmental problems needs large budgets and various technologies, and the government and corporations have the ability to deal with these problems. For example, air pollution and water quality has concerned many countries, and the government is able to implement some policies and invest money to reduce air pollution, while companies also can enhance their technologies to curb emission of contaminated water and substances. However, individuals are unable to cope with these things.\nBesides, the government and firms could have significant influences on environmental awareness of people. It is necessary for every citizen to have the awareness and knowledge of environment protection. This means that we should convey corresponding policies and knowledge to the public and society, and the government controls many influential media, such as TV stations and newspapers, which can provide plenty of environmental knowledge and related policies to citizens.\nOn the other hand, it is possible for ordinary people to participate in some actions of environment protection, and they also can benefit from the improvement of environment. For instance, many people driving private cars could cause air pollution, and overusing plastic packages would affect the environment.
