{"id": "essay189", "input": "Do you think it is good for teenagers to work while schooling?\n\nIn my opinion, it is not the good idea for teenagers to have job while they are still students. Although, many argue that it provide good working experience, but I think it can interfere with their life in various ways. Having jobs would affect the health of the student. It divert their mind from studies and would take away their childhood phase from their life.\nA student has to do lots of studies in today's competitive world to prove himself. He has to spend his most of time in school to get a good grades. If the student get involved himself in job in rest of the time, then it would cause an extra burden on them. Furthermore, jobs has various responsibilities like attendance, sometimes extra work and so on. This would result in stress, tension and tiredness. They won't be able to get proper time for relaxation, sleep. Thus, would affect their mental and physical health.\nAnother reason, jobs can divert students from their studies. If students started earning in earlier age in their life, then they get attracted towards money. They feel themselves independent and would prefer to work more for money. This would affect their studies, they loose their interest from studies. Moreover, they drop out their studies so as to earn more money.\nIn addition to this, the main drawback of teenagers job is that, they miss out the fun of their childhood time. He would miss various childhood activities such as hang out with friends, clubs and fun activities and social interaction with others. They have whole life to do job and prove themselves, but the childhood phase will never return in their life. Therefore, they should take advantage of life as much possible they can.\nThus, for a teenager it is important to pay attention on their studies. Having job would affect their health, divert them from studies and take away one of the important phase from their life.", "framework": "synthetic", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 79, "to": 158}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 170, "to": 220}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 234, "to": 282}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 284, "to": 334}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 336, "to": 427}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 429, "to": 510}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 512, "to": 575}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 577, "to": 684}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 699, "to": 780}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 782, "to": 832}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 834, "to": 893}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 901, "to": 946}]}, {"id": 12, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 964, "to": 1007}]}, {"id": 13, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1009, "to": 1104}]}, {"id": 14, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1106, "to": 1178}]}, {"id": 15, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1180, "to": 1251}]}, {"id": 16, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1263, "to": 1315}]}, {"id": 17, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1338, "to": 1427}]}, {"id": 18, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1429, "to": 1562}]}, {"id": 19, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1564, "to": 1672}]}, {"id": 20, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1685, "to": 1745}]}, {"id": 21, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 1753, "to": 1817}]}, {"id": 22, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1819, "to": 1938}]}], "edges": [{"source": 7, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 20, "target": 17, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 20, "target": 18, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 20, "target": 19, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 11, 12, 20, 21, 22]}
{"id": "essay085", "input": "Use of CCTV cameras\n\nToday, close circuit television (CCTV) cameras are widely used in a variety of circumstances. They are used in schools, businesses and some other premises in order to monitor the activities taking place. It is undeniable that the use of CCTV has plenty of benefits to offer, especially in reducing crimes and protecting the employees in a premise. Nevertheless, some argue that these cameras invade their privacies due to constantly being monitored. Even so, I strongly believe that CCTV cameras should be installed in every premise to combat the ever increasing theft rate and to protect the workers at the workplace.\nFirstly, by having CCTV cameras at workplace, crimes such as robbery can be trimmed down. This is because when a shop is attacked by thieves, the clips taken by these cameras serve as a source of evidence to help the thieves to be traced. To illustrate this further, in Malaysia, policemen used the videos captured by the CCTV cameras to trace and successfully catch a group of robbers who broke into a Seven Eleven shop during the midnight. Not only that, as the employees know that they are under constant surveillance, they will less likely steal from the shops. Thus, it is clear that CCTVs must be put in all workplace so that crime rates can be minimized.\nFurthermore, at some offices, employees are often required to handle angry or frustrated customers. At times, face-to-face interactions with an annoyed customer can put the employee in physical danger. Hence, the installation of CCTV cameras may help the employees escape this situation because the customers know very well that their conversations are recorded. In the event of an argument, the videotapes can used to determine what actually took place and further actions can be then taken. In short, these cameras can help to provide some form of protection to the workers against the customers.\nLooking from another perspective, the use of CCTV cameras does cause controversy. Those opposing the CCTV systems feel that their privacies are invaded with the constant monitoring of the cameras. However, one must realize that safety is of paramount importance compared to privacy and prevention is always better than suffering from the consequences. Ergo, opponents of this system should try to comprehend the situation and take actions to prevent themselves from being victims of crime.\nTo conclude, CCTV cameras are essential and therefore must be installed in every premise. This is chiefly to shield oneself from being harmed by any intruders or robbers. Admittedly, privacies are lost with the use of these cameras. Nonetheless, safety should be put first in order to be safe.\n", "framework": "synthetic", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 504, "to": 638}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 649, "to": 728}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 746, "to": 877}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 907, "to": 1080}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1097, "to": 1204}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1229, "to": 1300}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1315, "to": 1400}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1412, "to": 1502}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1511, "to": 1588}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1597, "to": 1663}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1694, "to": 1793}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1805, "to": 1899}]}, {"id": 12, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1983, "to": 2096}]}, {"id": 13, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 2107, "to": 2251}]}, {"id": 14, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 2259, "to": 2389}]}, {"id": 15, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 2404, "to": 2479}]}, {"id": 16, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 2481, "to": 2560}]}, {"id": 17, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 2574, "to": 2622}]}, {"id": 18, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 2637, "to": 2683}]}], "edges": [{"source": 5, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 8, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 11, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 14, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 16, "target": 17, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 17, "target": 18, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 5, 11, 12, 15, 16]}

We need farmland to grow crops such as wheat and corn, and there is no doubt that without food people cannot alive for more than some weeks. Therefore, farmlands are vital for human life.\nSecondly, people need shelters to protect themselves from mother nature such as wind and flood and wild animals, so they need land to build their houses on it. Dwelling is one of the most important human needs after food which is undeniable.\nFinally, human need some crucial things to continue their life, and most of them are industrial such as medicine.

{"id": "essay248", "input": "Choosing the job that is similar to parents' jobs could benefit to one's career\n\nWhen choosing a job, one need to consider it thoroughly. Whether to choose a job which is similar to parents' job or not, different people may hold different opinions. As far as I am concerned, I think choosing the job that is similar to parents' jobs could benefit to one's career. \nFirst of all, as parents are involved in the same environment, they could thus support much more to their children, such as domain knowledge and industry-related information. For example, my father is a software programmer, and he indeed teaches me a lot in programming and some computer knowledge. Whenever I met a difficulty, I would reach him for consulting. Because he has many experiences, I could save enormous time in finding solution. This truly makes me more competitive than my colleagues. If I worked in the different field from my father, I would have faced much difficulty than I do now.\nNevertheless, since parents have worked in tens of years, they have accumulated a rich network in a certain industry. They have a deep insight in it and could provide much support to their children. For instance, they know which company has better welfare or provides better education. Moreover, their friends in the same industry can even help to write recommendation letters to some certain companies. It is undoubted that a good recommendation letter is extraordinary important in this competitive society. When others are still struggling in preparing their resume, one with a good recommendation letter has already passed the first stage in the interviewing process. \nSome may argue that as time is different, the condition of job market is completely different. Therefore, choosing a job similar to one's parents' is not always a correct decision. I agree with this opinion to some extent, but when it comes to the trend, no one can predict it correctly. The condition of job market changes enormously fast like a flash, so that there is no way to predict any job can be popular for 30 years or more.\nIn considering whether one should choose a job similar to his or her parents', I have mentioned a few reasons that one can get more support from his or her parents if they are in the same industry.

Compassion, a virtue preached in almost all religions from Buddhism to Mohammedanism, is what distinguishes us human beings from animals.\nEconomically speaking, such aid could also create a win-win situation.

For developed nations, new medical problems may very well arise from the work in underdeveloped nations; thus related research is conducted accordingly to conquer the problem, promoting the development of the pharmaceutical industry. The potential market in those poor countries, most of which has a huge population, is also a thing worth mentioning. By building a good relationship with them, wealthy nations can not only broaden their global market, but also facilitate future international commerce. The underdeveloped nations, in return, may export local agricultural products, mineral products with discount to the former, boosting each other's economy.\nIn summary, wealthy nations' offering in need is not only a moral deed, but also a worthwhile one which will one day pay off in other ways.

However, class is not the only source of knowledge. Students also learn from other sources such as experience, libraries and other people. I think going to classes should be optional for students for the following reasons.\nFirstly, the reason why university students should not be required to attend class is sometimes the students in the university can learn better from other sources outside the class room. Student can also study by themselves in the library and focus on only the topic they do not understand. For example, I have a close friend who was in the same department with me in the university. She learned quickly and understood everything in class so fast. Thus, she rarely went to class but spent most time to understand confusing topic. Finally, she got very good grade when she was graduation.\nSecondly, students should not be required to attend classes because they can manage the time spending on classes to do other benefit things if they already understand topic in the class very well. In my experience, many times I did not attend biology class because my university does not require the students to attend classes. Also, I had already studied all biology topics before attending university.

They make people to eat more rubbish food, spend less time with their friends and family, and be someone that are not themselves. \nThere are a lot of people eating foods or snacks when they are watching television. Most of the foods they eat are fat foods like chips or pizzas. It is not rocket science to know that these foods are not good for people’s health. Many companies know about this behavior and use advertisements on television to make people buy more of these foods. In turn, people will consume these rubbish foods more and we have to deal with a lot of fat diseases.\nTelevision and movies also make people to spend more time on their couch than with their family and friends, especially children. They communicate less with their parents because a lot of their time is used watching television and movies. When people are watching television or movies together, they also talk less to each other, compare to when playing social games, such as parlor games, together.\nTelevision and movies nowadays contain a lot of advertisements. These advertisements build ideal images that make people to feel bad about themselves and want to be more like these images. When people see beautiful women and men on the advertisements, they think that they are ugly. Thus they spend a lot of money to buy a lot of beauty products or go to gym to get better appearance or body. When a cool hero characters in a movie smokes and yet a lot of people like him, then people who idolize him may also begin to smoke although they don’t prefer it.\nI think television and movies are entertaining but most of the time they influence people’s behavior in bad ways.

If not, you might lose another chance that you could use to accomplish other things. So, I definitely believe that you should focus on what you are good at.\nFocusing what you are good at helps you attain your goal. Without doubt, the more time you spend on what you do well, the more likely to achieve something great you will be. For instance, Albert Einstein, one of the most competent physicians in history, devoted most of his life to develop theory in physics and finally established special and general relativity. Instead, he hardly cared about something else. It is said that, surprisingly, he never tried to distinguish a hand soup and a facial soup because, at least for him, using two different soups properly was quite annoying. As the example above indicates, you will be more likely to accomplish your purpose by concentrating on what you do well.\nIf you keep doing what you already do well, you can be better good at it. When you're doing something well, you will feel more satisfied and more interested in it. Then, you will motivate yourself to do more. To give an example, I used to be good at math when I was in junior high school.

As a result, I could not only get higher scores in math test but also solve the university-level problems.

Moreover, applying technological science into the preparation of medications also plays a significant role in saving the number of patients' lives.\nHowever, some negative aspects of technological process need to be mentioned clearly. In spite of bring fantastic advantages, technological products have devastated the natural environment indirectly through its production process. This is because exploiting and collecting raw materials as well as essential fuels to serve the production of technological products have destroyed nature seriously.

{"id": "essay081", "input": "Artists' freedom to express ideas\n\nArtists in most countries are given the freedom to express their thoughts in whatever they do. Nevertheless, some argue that there should be government restrictions in order to limit their opinions. I however, agree to this only to a certain extent and believe that the artists must be given freedom so that they will produce some really marvelous masterpiece.\nFirst and foremost, if there is control over artists' ideas, they will definitely lose their sense of creativity in the long run. It is undeniable that when they are given the opportunity to express themselves, most artists will think out of the box and come up with spectacular Arts such as paintings or movies. For example, paintings by Da Vinci and Michallengo are admired even till now as they were not restricted during those times. In short, without any limitations, there will be more awe inspiring work from our artists.\nFurthermore, it is every human's right to be able to voice out their opinions in any ways as long as they do not cause any problems to the nation. Today, many countries make numerous efforts to show that they are democratic countries. Arts is one of the ways that can be used to criticise social problems and government policies in a particular country. To illustrate this further, the famous movie '3 Idiots' acted by Amir Khan criticises the education system which is chiefly based on memorising and not being able to apply whatever the students learn. Thus, human rights is violated if artists are not allowed to express their feelings freely.\nLooking from another perspective, there are certain drawbacks if artists are not restricted. They might go deeper into certain aspects that can cause controversies in a country. To cite an example, Malaysia is a multiracial country whereby all the citizens live together in harmony and peace. In case there is anyone who brings up some sensitive issues in their films or books regarding any races, this might end up in some chaos among the society. Nonetheless, I believe that artists know their boundaries very well and would surely do not want their names tarnished just because of their unscrupulous acts.\nTo conclude, it is now evident that there should not be any restrictions on artists' work. Allowing them to think freely will give them an opportunity to express themselves as ideas can naturally flow when there are no limitations. Hence, even though freedom to express ideas can bring some negative effects, I certainly believe that there are many wonderful and beautiful Arts due to the freedom to express ideas and thus, I strongly believe there should be no restrictions on them.\n", "framework": "synthetic", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 301, "to": 394}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 416, "to": 524}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 548, "to": 707}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 722, "to": 832}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 844, "to": 923}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 938, "to": 1070}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1072, "to": 1158}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1160, "to": 1277}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1307, "to": 1478}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1486, "to": 1570}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1665, "to": 1748}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1770, "to": 1863}]}, {"id": 12, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1865, "to": 2019}]}, {"id": 13, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 2049, "to": 2179}]}, {"id": 14, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 2217, "to": 2270}]}, {"id": 15, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 2272, "to": 2353}]}, {"id": 16, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 2357, "to": 2411}]}, {"id": 17, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 2420, "to": 2488}]}, {"id": 18, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 2515, "to": 2594}]}, {"id": 19, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 2624, "to": 2663}]}], "edges": [{"source": 4, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 4, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 5, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 9, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 11, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 15, "target": 16, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 15, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 18, "target": 17, "label": "Attack"}], "tops": [0, 4, 9, 12, 14, 18, 19]}

Research showed that friends that we made in university are more likely to be life time friends and this especially applicable to roommate. In my personal opinion, the most important quality of roommates is being considered. In the meantime, communication is also another essential particularity of a good roommate. \nConsideration is always important in relationship. For example, roommate turns down the music or television volume at night time. Sometimes we will not know what we have done until we have a taste of our own medicine. At all times, think about the other's feeling before doing any self-centered action would help to improve the roommate relationship tremendously. Therefore, having a considered roommate is significantly imperative to our school life. It will not only prevent conflicts but also to have a friend or even a family member.\nMoreover, communication is as well making a good roommate. People have different habit in daily life, such as tidy the blanket in the morning. One might think this is a piece of cake while other would consider it as immense project. If one requested to move out just because his roommate do not tidy up the blanket in the morning might be crying over split milk. Therefore, communication is very important as it would clear up the misinterpretation. Through communication, bonded are build and we could have better understanding of each others.\nIn conclusion, there are many valuable factors about roommate that are important.

In my opinion, a professor should spend more time doing research rather than educating students for a few reasons following.\nA professor means a researcher or an expert of a specific science subject. He or she should always keep the passion in her field so that he or she could push him/herself forward all the time. And then he or she can do better in teaching works. For instance, the most impressive professor during my studying in university is Mr. Yang who keeps in researching and reading. He is also the one who gave us inspiration and taught us the way to study more efficient by ourselves. All of my classmates gave him a rank of AAA, the excellent teacher.\nAs for students, we can get what we want to know from textbooks, webs or teachers. But we can only turn to our professors when we want to take part in a research and to get ourselves promoted. If a professor doesn't get any researching works, he cannot give us the opportunity. In addition, a professor who is concentrate in his or her research is thinking and creating new ideas all the time. He or she may stimulate us students to come up with some creative sugesstions. That is good for both of the professor and students.\nFinally, all professors in the university are fortune of the society. They are the leaders almost in every fields of science, arts, culture and so on. Without their research, there will be no new technologies come out quickly.

{"id": "essay067", "input": "Creative Artists\n\nInnovative artists bring enjoyment and inspiration to our sometimes tedious life; however, some people deem that artists have been entrusted with too much freedom and power and should be restricted by the government. It is my personal belief that freedom of expressing thoughts and ideas should always be eulogized and it's rather iniquitous to impose a shackle on artists' will to create.\nOne of the major concerns against freeing artists' creation derives from the fear of social misleading which would destabilize the society; however, I believe the audiences have their own judgement and are not likely to be misled or influenced by some art work. It is needless to say that art inevitably involves imagination, exaggeration and sometimes is purely fabricated; regardless of whether the work of art is based on truth or not, it is the public's authority to determine how to interpret its meaning. If the art displays unreality, the public audiences certainly have the acumen to recognise its untruthfulness and only appreciate its art value; if the art reflects the reality, then what would be the intention to ban it if it was not for covering the dirty truth? Would it be autocratic if the government clamp down the artists who are telling the truth? In a word, the notion of being afraid of social misleading is unjustified.\nLet's then take a look at the impact that art has posed on individuals. It is undeniable that some of the art work may contain negative implications such as insanity, violence, eroticism etc. I absolutely agree that restrictions on exposure to adolescents should apply as adolescents are not mature enough to avoid being led astray by these contents; however, in the case of adults being the audience, there's really nothing to hide – these negative things objectively exist on this planet and it is impossible for adults to be brain-washed only because of some pieces of creative art.\nBy way of conclusion, I do not root for the idea that restrictions should be put on artists work; on the contrary, they should be encouraged to express their innovative ideas – this world needs them to make itself colourful.\n", "framework": "synthetic", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 265, "to": 406}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 408, "to": 546}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 567, "to": 668}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 697, "to": 917}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 919, "to": 1062}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1286, "to": 1348}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1444, "to": 1540}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1566, "to": 1618}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1622, "to": 1699}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1710, "to": 1934}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 2051, "to": 2110}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 2113, "to": 2159}]}], "edges": [{"source": 1, "target": 2, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 1, "target": 3, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 1, "target": 4, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 1, "target": 5, "label": "Attack"}, {"source": 7, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 7, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 1, 7, 10, 11]}
{"id": "essay288", "input": "One important thing that I want to change about my hometown\n\nPublic utilities and surroundings are the primary factors which we basically consider before we decide to live in a place. However, it is difficult to find a community which can perfectly meet our requirements. In my hometown, there are almost complete public utilities for one’s needs but transportation. So the thing that I really want to change is to have more public transportation. Since I’m facing the traffic congestion every day. And this problem seem to get worst. \nAt first, it should have more alternatives to use public transportation, such as a subway train or a sky train. Hence, people will have more ways to go to a place. Since now buses are only a kind of public transportation in this community, It makes people in this area have no choice. They must take only a bus to go to another place. If a subway and a sky train are available here, it will be more convenience to them. For example, people can estimate time from taking a subway train due to the train schedule. On the contrary they cannot do so in case of a bus. Also, this improvement will decrease a bad traffic on the road indirectly. \nSecondly, the buses provide merely two routes in this community. It is absolutely a major problem. For example, if a place I intend to go is not in the route of buses, I still have to take a bus that does not bring me to my destination but go to the center station first to exchange to another bus. Obviously, it is waste of time. They should increase more routes to make people transport more easily.\nLastly, having more kinds of public transportation can dwindle the number of people using their own cars. Also, it provides many advantages. For instance, people can save their expenses form gasoline, which nowadays is getting more expensive. The necessary energy will slowly be used up, since people use less their own cars.\nTo sum up, the transportation is an elementary factor which directly affects to people’s living. I wish one day this problem would be changed.

{"id": "essay099", "input": "Taking a break before starting higher education is a good idea\n\nNowadays, it is an increasingly common trend to take a break before starting university studies. It is not just becoming common among rich students but also in the poor students. Students take a break of year or two, some students travel all around the world during this time, and some choose to take up a job.\nExperience gained through traveling to different places, meeting different people and even at job goes long way. It not only enhances the confidence of a student but also makes them independent. Student's who works tend to gather better financial resources which they can rely on during their university studies. This experience also makes them aware of what they would like to make of their life. They develop broader view and can make a better choice of their future studies or courses.\nTaking a break not just has benefits but it also comes with some negative impacts. Once student's starts earning, they might not like to go back to studies where they would lose their financial independence. They might even find it difficult to adapt to education environment. There is also a risk of student never going back to university or higher education. Probably some might take some short term courses instead of proper and complete university education, which will help them to get a better job and salaries. This might only help them in a short run as it is a known fact that to make a reasonable career in longer runs, one needs a proper and higher qualification.\nIn my view point, I would agree to idea of taking a break before starting higher education. Students who take break, gain lot of benefits by traveling around the places or by working. They tend to contribute more due to their real world experiences which makes them more mature.\n", "framework": "synthetic", "time": "2020-08-05", "flavor": 0, "version": 1.0, "language": "en", "provenance": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "source": "https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp/research_6/data/argumentation_mining_1/argument_annotated_essays_version_2/index.en.jsp", "nodes": [{"id": 0, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 375, "to": 486}]}, {"id": 1, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 488, "to": 568}]}, {"id": 2, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 570, "to": 686}]}, {"id": 3, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 688, "to": 771}]}, {"id": 4, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 773, "to": 862}]}, {"id": 5, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 864, "to": 945}]}, {"id": 6, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 947, "to": 1070}]}, {"id": 7, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1072, "to": 1139}]}, {"id": 8, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1141, "to": 1223}]}, {"id": 9, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1225, "to": 1380}]}, {"id": 10, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1382, "to": 1537}]}, {"id": 11, "label": "MajorClaim", "anchors": [{"from": 1557, "to": 1629}]}, {"id": 12, "label": "Claim", "anchors": [{"from": 1631, "to": 1721}]}, {"id": 13, "label": "Premise", "anchors": [{"from": 1723, "to": 1816}]}], "edges": [{"source": 0, "target": 1, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 0, "target": 2, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 0, "target": 3, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 0, "target": 4, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 6, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 7, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 8, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 9, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 5, "target": 10, "label": "Support"}, {"source": 12, "target": 13, "label": "Support"}], "tops": [0, 5, 11, 12]}
